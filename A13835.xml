            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S God is the Author of all bleſsings, ſo likewiſe of all judgements; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie and adverſitie, ſweete and bitter waters, both theſe proceede from the ſame fountaine, but in a different manner: he begins with bleſsings, and then onely proceedes to judgements, when theſe are not anſwered with dutifull obedience, he doth not firſt come in ſtormes and tempeſts, but in the ſtill, and gentle voyce of his mercies, becauſe he would rather haue men to magnifie the riches of his mercies, than complaine vnder the ſeveritie of his judgements; accounting it more glory to be loved for his goodnes, than feared for his greatnes: beſides the bleſsings of God, they haue no motiue to ſtirre him vp to the beſtowing of them; but within himſelfe and in his owne nature, but his judgements haue their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and foundation in mans ſinne, bleſsings and judgements they come from God, as hony and the ſting doe from the Bee; the Bee makes hony natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſtings not vnleſſe ſhe be provoked; ſo it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and connaturall to the goodnes of God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it ſelfe in the beſtowing of bleſsings; but not to inflict judgements vnles he be provoked vnto it, <hi>He puniſheth not willingly, neyther takes he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb facs="tcp:19096:4"/> in afflicting the children of men. LAM. 3.33.</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe the beſtowing of bleſsings it is his proper worke: <hi>Quod in Deo eſt ſufficit ad completam ejus rationem,</hi> as the Schoole ſpeakes, all that is required for the exerciſe of it is in God himſelfe, no merit or motiue at all in the creature: but the inflicting of Iudgements, it is his ſtrange worke. <hi>Eſai. 28.21.</hi> It is <hi>opus ſuum alienum,</hi> ſo his worke that another alſo hath a hand in it, it cannot come from him alone, but by occaſion of the creatures diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and it is the common fault of men in times of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, when the hand of God is vpon them, and his judgements abroad in the world, that they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſuch impreſsions on their ſoules, as thoſe paſſages of Gods providence towards them are apt to beget, but are either ſecure and ſenſles of the hand of God which is out againſt them; or neglectiue in vſing the meanes for the removall of it, till they haue outſtrayed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and it be too late. Of the former ſort are thoſe who are taken with a ſleepie Lethargie of ſinne, and cannot be awaked; or rather with a dead Palſie, as men that haue no vſe of their ſpirituall ſenſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they ſleepe ſecurely in the midſt of the Sea, and on the top of the Mast: when they are ſmitten they perceiue it not, and when they are beaten they feele not the ſmart; <hi>Pro. 23.24.</hi> Of ſuch the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines to God; <hi>Thou haſt ſmitten them, but they haue not grieved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they haue refuſed to receiue correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; they haue made their faces harder than a ſtone, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to returne; Ier. 5.3.</hi> Of the latter ſort are thoſe, who never thinke of preparing to meet the Lord with
<pb facs="tcp:19096:4"/> ſubmiſsion, and ſupplication, with prayers and teares, ſo long as the Iudgement hangs in the Clouds, or fals beſides themſelues, or doth but lightly touch them, till God make way through their bowels for his owne prayſe, and out of the aſhes of their ruine rayſe vp glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to himſelfe. So it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> God fore-warned them of his wrath, and ſet his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments daily before them, but they ſtopped their eares, and would not heare, they hardened their hearts and would not be reformed, till vnavoydable judgement fell vpon them, and <hi>there was no remedie: 2 Chro. 36.16.</hi> O marke and conſider well, that expreſſion; <hi>there was no remedie!</hi> If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would haue layd it to heart before, <hi>there was a remedy,</hi> they might haue prevented it by timely repentance; but now the ſentence being paſt, and the decree put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, <hi>there was no remedie;</hi> So it was with the old world, notwithſtanding all the warning which <hi>Noah</hi> had given them of a future Iudgement, they neither humbled themſelues, nor reformed what was amiſſe in them, till the Floud came and ſwept them all away, and <hi>there was no remedie,</hi> ſo that Iudgement threatned, it may be neglected ſo long, till it become vnavoydable, and <hi>there be no remedie.</hi> Two things there are then which God eſpecially aymes at when his Iudgements are abroad in the world firſt to giue them notice that himſelfe is highly diſpleaſed with their ſinnes; ſecondly, that it is now high time for them to thinke of agreeing with their Adverſary, and making their peace with him.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> When God warres out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and reveales his wrath from heaven againſt the ſinnes of his people,
<pb facs="tcp:19096:5"/> it is a ſigne he is highly diſpleaſed with them; for God is knowne by executing Iudgement. <hi>Pſal. 9.16.</hi> That is, he makes it knowne to the ſonnes of men, how he ſtands affected to them, and to their ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods viſitations are termed <hi>Iudgements,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not come caſually but Iudicially; there is great cauſe moving him to it, becauſe men are deafe againſt all the ſweet charmes of his mercies, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure againſt all the thunder of his threatnings, and therefore he is conſtrained as it were to ſpeake vnto them in a ſtrange language, even the language of his hands; to ſpeake words that may be felt, even ſwords, famines, plagues, peſtilence, that men might know that his Word of threatning it is no vaine Word, but as he hath ſaid vnto them, ſo he meanes to deale with them; according to that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. <hi>48.8. As we haue heard ſo haue wee ſeene in the Citie of our God.</hi> (It is true both of his mercies and judgements, <hi>God will not alter the word that is gone out of his mouth,</hi> whether it be a word of promiſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,) ſuch is the hardneſſe of mens hearts, that though they heare the Word daily ſounding in their eares, and telling them that <hi>the wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven againſt all vngodlineſſe and vnrighteouſneſſe of men. Rom. 1.18.</hi> Yet they will not beleeue it, except they ſee ſome reall examples of it, they are ready to ſay of Gods threatning, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did of Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>Ioh. 20.24. Except I ſee in his hands the print of the nayles, &amp; put my finger into his ſides, I will never beleeue it;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſtretches out his hand againſt them, he powres his wrath and indignation vpon them, that
<pb facs="tcp:19096:5"/> when they lie bleeding vnder his hand, then they might be ſenſible of his high diſpleaſure; when they feele the ſharpneſſe of his arrowes, then I might ſay with the Prophet; <hi>Who can ſtand before his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Who may abide the fierceneſſe of his wrath? Nah. 1.6.</hi> When they ſee his lips full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and his eyes ſparkle out flames of fire vpon them; then they might call to minde that of <hi>David; As wee haue heard, ſo haue wee ſeene in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our God;</hi> as we haue heard his high diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure threatned, ſo haue we ſeene it executed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> When God is vp in Armes (as it were) againſt his people, it is to let them know, that it is now high time for them to thinke of returning to him, and making their peace with him, and that conſidering the ſeaſon, that it is now high time they ſhould awake from ſleepe. <hi>Rom. 13.11.</hi> There is no time vnſeaſonable for the duties of repentance and humiliation, but when the face of Heaven begins to frowne vpon men for their vnthankfulneſſe and diſobedience, when his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſeene abroad in the earth; then it is high time to reforme what is amiſſe, and returne vnto him, becauſe this is the laſt meanes God will vſe for their good; if they will yet ſtand out and not ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; if they will not for all this come in and lay downe their weapons of rebellion; if they will not onely fit out his mercies, but his judgements too; then he will be to <hi>Ephraim</hi> as a Lyon, and as a young Lyon to the houſe of <hi>Iudah:</hi> He will teare and breake in peices; He will carry away &amp; none ſhall deliver; <hi>Hoſ. 5.14.</hi> And therefore when God begins to draw forth his glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Sword, and his hand layes hold on Iudgement;
<pb facs="tcp:19096:6"/> When he begins to ſpeake in his wrath, and ſay; Thus will I doe to thee O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> O then let every one thinke it high time to prepare to meet the Lord his God; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos 4.12.</hi> It is his great happines that through Gods mercy, he can ſay, it is yet time, that it is not yet too late; that as yet it is not without hope to returne; God might haue cut him off long agoe, and if he had done ſo, it had but beene juſtice on Gods part, and deſert on his owne; but the doore of mercy yet ſtands open, God is yet willing to receiue his people, if they would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto him; for to that end he ſpeakes to them, to that end he deales with them, to that end he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulates the matter with them on this manner; Is there no hope? Will nothing worke vpon you? No meanes? no mercies? no threatnings? No Iudgements? will yee not flie from the wrath to come? O why will yee not? why will yee die O ye houſe of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Will yee not returne vnto mee? Oh my people why will ye not returne? What haue I done vnto you? Wherein haue I grieued you, that yee ſhould bee ſo vnwilling to lay downe your weapons of rebellion that yee haue taken vp againſt mee? Theſe and ſuch like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from God; what doe they imply? but that there is yet a time of mercy, euen while the heauens ſeeme to bee clouded ouer with indignation, that when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wrath ſhewes it ſelfe, there is yet a time wherein mercie may bee found if it bee ſued for; if euer there bee a time that ſhould bring men vpon their knees, and make them earneſt in ſueing for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ſurely then it is high time aboue all other times to cry mightily to God, becauſe this is the laſt time that ever he will waite to haue mercy vpon them; and
<pb facs="tcp:19096:6"/> never doe men ſhew themſelues more vnlike to men, that is, to reaſonable creatures, than to ſtand out when God ſummons them to come in, and ſubmit themſelues. What more vnreaſonable then to make him an enemy, who is the fountaine of all that good which they haue, or can hope for? What more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable then when they haue prouoked him to wrath and made him their enemy, and now even lie at the foote of his mercie, then to capitulate and ſtand vpon tearmes with him? yea, with him who when he might let looſe his hand, and diſpatch them at one blow; yet offereth to ſpare them, if yet at laſt they would even now cloſe with him. There be two ſorts of arguments whereby God convinceth his people of the vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of their ſinfull courſes; Firſt, by ſending them to the Heathen, who might be thought the moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable amongſt men; and yet even they would be aſhamed, and thinke it moſt vnreaſonable to deale ſo with their Idols, as many doe with the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Goe ye now to the Iles of</hi> Chittim <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and ſend to</hi> Kedar <hi>and take diligent heed, and ſee whether there be any ſuch thing; hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nations changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods? But my people haue changed their glory for that which profiteth not;</hi> Ier. <hi>2.10.11.</hi> Secondly, not finding any amongſt men ſo vnreaſonable with whom he may ſort them; he ſeekes amongſt the vnreaſonable and ſenſeleſſe creatures, to ſee if there be any there with whom he may ſuit them; he compares them to the bruit beaſts, and if there be any more brutiſh than others, it is to thoſe bruits that are moſt blockiſh, to the Horſe and Mule, to the Oxe
<pb facs="tcp:19096:7"/> and Aſſe: Pſal. <hi>49.20. Man being in honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth not, but is like the beaſt that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth:</hi> and it is no ſmall diſparagement to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be matched with the vnreaſonable beaſt, for to be like unto a beaſt in that ſenſe is worſe then to be a beaſt indeed; to be a beaſt indeed it is without any fault in the Creature, it was God that made it ſo, but to be made a man &amp; to be like a beaſt, that is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his owne fault, without his great ſin; which makes him a reaſonable beaſt, or rather an unreaſonable man; yea ſuch is the unreaſonableneſſe of men in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſes, that they are not onely compared to the bruit beaſts, but thoſe unreaſonable creatures prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before them; <hi>Iſay 1.3. The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters crib; but Iſrael hath not known, my people haue not underſtood.</hi> God ſets men to ſchoole to the very bruit Creatures, that they might learne of theſe how to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. <hi>Pro. 6.6. Goe to the Piſmire O ſluggard, behold her wayes and be wiſe.</hi> Theſe ſilly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Creatures, they are ſet before men as pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, they are ſet over them as Tutors, to teach them wiſedome. Yea more, when God finds none amongst bruit beaſts ſo unreaſonable in their carriage as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinners be, he goes one ſtep further, and tryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the inſenſible creatures, if there he might find any prints or footſteps of ſuch demeanure, and there he finds them more ſenſles than ſtockes and ſtones; for the ſtones cleaue aſunder, and the rockes are moved when God is angry; yea the hills melt and the mountaines ſhake &amp; tremble before him, &amp; yet many men though they both heare and ſee the Iudgements of God; though
<pb facs="tcp:19096:7"/> there be enough ſpoken many times both to the eye and to the eare, to cleaue the very rocke aſunder, and to moue and affect the very mountaines, if poſsibly they were capable of any morall impreſsions; yet are they no more moved and affected with it than the very ſtones and earth which they ſtand vpon. And when men are thus farre degenerate and gone from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they come not onely below the nature of men, and of bruit beaſts, but even of ſtockes &amp; ſtones and ſenſles creatures; Is it not high time for man to returne into himſelfe, and to returne vnto God with ſubmiſsion and ſupplication; that God may repent him of the evill and turn from his fierce wrath that he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh not? And this is the ſumme and ſubſtance of this inſuing Treatiſe; which is ſpent upon ſome ſpeciall portions of holy Scripture, whereby theſe ſacred Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes may be actuated and enlivened: of the Author himſelfe, being no further knowne to me, than by his Labours and the reports of others, I will ſay nothing, but leaue his Workes to <hi>prayſe him in the gates.</hi> The ſeverall paſſages of the Diſcourſe being drawne into a Table, and layd out in their generall Heads, prevents my labour in ſhewing the vſe and profit that may be made of it; the matter it ſelfe as it was ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and proper for the time and places in which it was delivered, ſo being ſpent vpon thoſe common Theames, of <hi>Faſting, Watching, Prayer, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Humiliation, &amp;c.</hi> which are the daily imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of penitent ſinners, it cannot be vnſeaſonable for any time; nor is it any prejudice to the Treatiſe that diverſe haue written of the ſame ſubject vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Texts and portions of Scripture; for the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
<pb facs="tcp:19096:8"/> of gifts, phraſes, and expreſsions is moſt ſuitable to the diverſitie of ſeverall mens diſpotions, that will ſuite well with one that likes not another; It is no hurt to a man that comes into a Cookes ſhop, to haue his choyce of ſeverall diſhes, the varietie of dreſsing is no hinderance to his nouriſhment, he may feed vpon that which liketh him beſt; If a man were to provide a ſuit of apparell, it were no hurt to him to ſee diverſe pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, out of which he may pleaſe himſelfe in his own choyce; even ſo he that would provide a mourning ſuite for his own ſorrowfull heart, it is no hurt to him that out of the diverſe patternes of godly mens La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, he may make choyce of thoſe which are most ſuitable to his owne deſires. Amongst which, this modell may happily ſort better with thy affections <hi>(Chriſtian Reader)</hi> than ſome others; bleſſe GOD for the varietie of his goodneſſe in this kinde; out of this varietie make thine owne choyce, and the God of Heaven giue a rich bleſsing vnto it for thy ſoules good.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou all know, that the Lord is fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt three neighbour Counties, the Arrowes of his peſtilence are abroad, and beſides that bleeding <hi>Preſton,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Townes are wounded: now this Countie intends it ſelfe for the Skirmiſh; and to fight with Gods weapons, againſt Gods judgements. Faſting dayes are dayes of pitcht Battell; God fights, and the Supplicants fight; prayers are the ſhafts, which are delivered flying to heaven. There muſt be the Muſtring and Training of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, before the day of the ſet Encounter, that wee may know our Poſtures, and the uſe of our weapons. I haue therefore for this Time, altered my wonted travaile in thoſe divine Lectures of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that I might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my ſelfe very plainely for your preparation, I haue beſtowed ſome thoughts upon a plaine Story. It is the ſtory of <hi>Gibeahs</hi> ſinne, <hi>Benjamins</hi> patronizing of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and at length the juſt revenge, of both <hi>Gibeah</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19096:22"/> the whole Tribe: for upon that <hi>Stuprum,</hi> and the wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Levits complaint, <hi>Iſrael</hi> warres, &amp; at laſt overcomes. It was a diſorderd government, when a Levite by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Cuſtom and Connivence held a Concubine, (ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned times when Levites are ſo ſcandalous) but ſhee that was light is alſo inconſtant, and runs from her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to her Father. The Levite follows, and after fiue dayes delay &amp; feaſting, he returnes with her, and though benighted on the way, yet his zeale againſt Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will not let him lodge in <hi>Iebus,</hi> but he travails on, though late to <hi>Gibeah;</hi> where he found, what he feard in <hi>Iebus,</hi> though not ſtrangers to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet ſtrangers to Humanitie; in their heate of luſt they both abuſe and murder the wanton Concubin. The Levite growes cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, that he might be juſt; he divides the carkaſſe, and ſends thoſe morſels of horror to plead his cauſe againſt the foule Citie. <hi>Iſrael</hi> purpoſes revenge, ſignifies this to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> in which Tribe, <hi>Gibeah</hi> was ſeated. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> quarrells the deſigne as a diſparagement to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and reſolue to patronize the Actors, where they ſhould puniſh the ſinne. Both ſides prepare to battell; <hi>Iſrael</hi> in an holy quarrell, <hi>Benjamin</hi> in an unjuſt; yet <hi>Benjamin</hi> twice prevailes, and triumphs in the double field. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſets a new day for a third fight, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prevaile they humble themſelues with faſting and prayer, then they haue the day, and the inſulting Tribe is foyled. Though I haue ſpeeded over the Story, I keep you too long from the Text; There is no difficulty in it: ſo farre as for the preſent occaſion wee may make uſe of it, wee may conſider theſe particulars..</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who they are, that are in this preparation: <hi>All the Children of Iſrael, all the people.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Where they aſſembled; <hi>Before the Lord, they went up, and came into the houſe of God.</hi>

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:19096:22"/>4. The time of their continuance in this preparation; <hi>They ſate there before the Lord, and faſted untill even.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. When they uſed this preparation: <hi>Then</hi> (i.e.) after their double overthrow.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The iſſue of this preparation, they had a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious hearing, an anſwere full of incouragement, and at length Victory.</p>
               <p>There is enough cut out, for more than an houre, but I entended the choice, not to inſiſt upon it; onely as a Ground to build ſome thoughts upon, which for the preſent may be ſuiteable to you, and the occaſions wee are ſhortly to meet about. So that what I ſhall now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, I will draw to this one head, from all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the preparation, and the event;</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Truth I ſhall, 1. Explicate. 2. Confirme. 3. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Explication, there are two things need clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:</p>

               <p n="2">2. How it is <hi>powerfull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

For the former of theſe, they had need to plead for their owne delicacie. Such as ſo farre departed from the true and moſt ancient uſe of faſting, as to dare the allowance of eating twice; to keepe the ſhadow of a Faſt were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to bring in the choice of Meates, and in this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Popiſh Faſt differs from the Common Table. This corrupt Cuſtome, was not brought in but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Firſt, the violent Onſet of the <hi>Ebionites, Encratites,</hi> and <hi>Manichees,</hi> was too blaſphemous and odious to be entertained. Secondly, others more ſubtilly, not daring to condemne the nature, endeavoured to cut off the uſe of Meates. The <hi>Montaniſts</hi> were in this, the firſt and the chiefe Agents. It was followed by <hi>Euſtathius</hi> the <hi>Armenian</hi> Monke, who is Cenſured in <hi>Sozomen,</hi>

When this Cuſtome grew more grievous, they invented choice of Meate to be in ſtead of <hi>Abſtinence.</hi> The Papiſts now dote on thoſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and are as various as in their ſects, all ſhunning fleſh, but differently things proceeding from fleſh: So they caſt ſnares on the Conſciences of their people, and abuſe their weakneſſe.

But how ever at all times tacite and implied, prayer being an act of Religion; where alwayes ſubmiſſion and dependancy muſt be manifeſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In petition, by the religious and humble repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our deſires before God, for impetration.</p>

               <p>To all theſe muſt be joyned <hi>Almes;</hi> elſe God diſtaſts the Faſt: <hi>Is is ſuch a Faſt as I haue choſen? A day for a man to afflict his ſoule? Wilt thou call this a Faſt, an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the Faſt that I haue choſen? To looſe the bands of wickedneſſe? Is it not to deale thy bread to the hungry? Eſay</hi> 58.5.6.7.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third branch in the method of the Text, the place of the <hi>Faſt,</hi> where they aſſembled, <hi>They came up unto the houſe of the Lord.</hi> In the more private perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the dutie, wee are not aſtricted to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place; but ſpeaking of a Faſt publique, and <hi>in aggregato,</hi> the houſe of prayer is deſigned the fitteſt place for the houſe of mourning. Herein the Papiſts are miſerable in their ſuperſtitious doatings, while they tye Faſts, and the different manner of faſts, unto particular places. Where a Cathedrall Church is dedicated to the name and memory of the <hi>bleſſed Virgin,</hi> there onely the people may eate fleſh on Saturdayes. I might adde more of theſe triflings, but I favour both you and my ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next is the Time of Continuance; <hi>They ſate there before the Lord, and faſted untill even.</hi> Yet the time hath not beene by all equally obſerved; <hi>David</hi> keepes it till <hi>the Sunne goe downe,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.35. <hi>Heſther</hi> and her maydes <hi>three dayes and nights, Eſt.</hi> 4.16. But in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, the time is ſet, <hi>from even to even: Lev.</hi> 23.32. So to meaſure the Faſt, as God hath meaſured the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt circumſtance in the Text, is the firſt word, <hi>Then;</hi> The time when wee are to faſt. The Papiſts haue their <hi>Stata Iejunia,</hi> and diſtinguiſh of ſet times, when tis lawfull, when unlawfull, when indifferent to faſt; but contrary to Scripture, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9.10. contrary to the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ry nature of a faſt, which is occaſionall, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an afflicting of the ſoule, ſuites moſt with a time of afflicting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15. And contrary to the ſtate of the more ancient Church. That is a full teſtimony of Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> in his 86. Epiſtle, upon what dayes we ought not to faſt, and upon what we ought, I finde not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the precept of our Lord, or of the Apoſtles. All that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſweres to this, is by leading us to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19096:25"/> Queſtion, that though it were not commanded in a written Scripture yet it might be in a Tradition, which anſwere is to anſwer nothing unleſſe that Queſtion were granted to their ſide. But <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the fift Booke of his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, faceth the Author out of the accuſation of <hi>Apollonius, Montanus</hi> the hereticke was that new Maſter, who gaue Lawes to faſting: What haue the Papiſts now to glory in? Or the Ieſuit to plead? But to the thing: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when overcome, haue recourſe to this Ordinance: There are two generall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To remoue or prevent evill; So <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> uſd it, when <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> were Confederate againſt <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.2.3. So <hi>Eſther,</hi> when the decree by the procurement of <hi>Haman</hi> came forth againſt the <hi>Iewes; Eſth:</hi> 4.3. So the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> when <hi>deſtruction within for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayes,</hi> was threatned againſt their Citie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To procure and obtaine good, whether temporall, ſo <hi>Ezra</hi> proclaimed it, that he might haue good ſucceſſe in his journey; or ſpirituall, ſo it is, to ſubdue the fleſh, to ſharpen prayer, to exerciſe our graces. This is the right manner of the faſt, rightly performed to right ends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing to be cleared, is, How this is powerfull. The Papiſts giue it a Merit; They ſay it is ſatisfactory, becauſe penall, that they proue from the fact of the <hi>Ninivites, Ion.</hi> 3.10. They ſay it is meritorious, if from charitie, that they proue from the words of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.17.18. But to the fact of the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> I anſwere, by diſtinguiſhing of a thing penall; it is taken Properly for the puniſhment of a former ſinne; but ſophiſtically for that which is laborious. In this latter ſenſe, it is not all one, to be penall and ſatisfactory; for there may be labour which is no puniſhment, and where there was no precedent ſin. In the former ſenſe, Faſting cannot be ſayd to be penall: A puniſhment is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly impoſed by the Iudge, not by the offender; but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19096:26"/> faſting is arbitrary, and by the offender taken up. Nor doth the Scripture in any place, call faſting a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither will that Story of the <hi>Ninivites</hi> proue it either a ſatisfaction or a puniſhment. To that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> from our Saviour, I anſwere by deniall, that every thing is meritorious to which a reward is given, for there may be a reward of Grace, as is diſputed ſtrongly againſt the Papiſts by many, in the Queſtion of merit. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is to the prayer, therefore but by accident to the faſt, but neither is the reward to prayer as of merit, for when we pray, wee ſupplicate and acknowledge our ſelues unworthy; therefore to faſting much leſſe is the reward of due. We conclude it then, that Faſting is not a part of worſhip, but a <hi>Medium;</hi> and in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, not properly a <hi>Medium,</hi> either to effect, or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing, but to diſpoſe unto the extraordinary exerciſe of prayer; and ſo it is ſaid to be powerfull; an helpe to that, to which the Scripture giues teſtimonie that it doth prevaile; <hi>The prayer of the righteous prevailes much if it be fervent.</hi> But of this more, in the ſecond bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe which we proceed unto, the proofe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, for the confirmation of this Truth, the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> is very expreſſe and comfortable: <hi>Turne unto mee with all your heart, with faſting, with weeping, and with mourning, rent your heart, and not your garment, and turne unto the Lord for he is gracious, who knoweth if he will returne and leaue a bleſſing behinde him? Blow the Trumpet in Zion, ſanctifie a Faſt, call a ſolemne aſſembly: Then will the Lord be jealous for his Land, and pittie his people. Ioel</hi> 2.12.13.14.15.18.19.20. I might be large in inſtances, your owne knowledge of them, may ſpare me a labour not needfull. I ſhall rather ſpend that time, to confirme it by ſome Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is powerfull with God, becauſe the meanes which himſelfe hath appointed to prevaile. Nothing can be powerfull with God, but as under the relation of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19096:26"/> an Ordinance: God puts efficiencie into every thing, as being the firſt mover of the wheeles in every engine. That God may be pacified, he muſt tell us, how he will be pacified, and we cannot fayle, when wee goe in the way of his owne appointments. <hi>Turne unto mee ſayth the Lord;</hi> There's the Ordinance; <hi>Then he will pittie his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> There's the iſſue of the Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is powerfull with God, becauſe moſt ſuiteable to thoſe Relations wee ſtand in toward God, the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Subjects, Servants, Supplicants, Offenders. Wee know that lowlineſſe hath an inſinuating and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning force; and Great Spirits are ſooneſt made ours, by ſtooping to them; as <hi>Tacitus</hi> notes judiciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the great <hi>Auguſta,</hi> though ſhe maligned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, ſhe was pittifull to the diſtreſſed, though an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. God hath beene pleaſed to manifeſt himſelfe ſuch, and ſo appeaſed; That <hi>he will reſiſt the proud, but giue grace unto the humble.</hi> But in our faſting, wee fall low before his foot-ſtoole, wee crouch unto our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, wee ſupplicate of our Iudge, we beg, and plead not, and prevaile.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Prayer that prevailes is hereby made more fervent. Prayer is the Toole, faſting giues the Toole an edge, makes it ſharper, and then it cuts more ſmoothly: It ſpecially remoues the impediments that make prayer ſlow:</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are impediments in the underſtanding, it helpes to illumine that. The crammed bodie is not ſo fit an organ for the purer ſoule to actuate it ſelfe within: wee ſee that abſtemious men are of more quickned ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. Thus the outward abſtinence is profitable, but more the inward ſpirit of a faſt, that is to be <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> and to them is the promiſe of a cleared Intellect, <hi>He will guide the humble in his way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are impediments in the will, it helpes to elevate that: the will comes thus to be weakened in its reſiſtance againſt God, and is made more ſpeedy in its
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19096:27"/> better motions; as the Hawke or the running dog, are better for the flight and ſpeed, when ſlenderly fed. The will is Bird-limed with the earth, and faſting doth unintangle it; then it becomes more apt for prayer: As it was a wittie note of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> concerning <hi>Elias, He went up to heaven by the ladder of faſting, before he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended in the Chariot of fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There are impediments in the affections, they are oft out of order, and diſquiet our devotion; it helpes to bridle them. Affections are ordinarily wanton, and then they grow imperious. When <hi>Hagar</hi> was entertained with reſpect <hi>ſhe deſpiſes her Miſtreſſe,</hi> but when checkt, ſhe growes modeſt. Faſting giues the correction to our too ſawcy ſervants, then they become ſerviceable, and waite upon prayer. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> learnt this method, while he profeſſeth, <hi>That he keepes under his body and brings it in ſubjection.</hi> Thus it addes ſpeed unto prayer, and there is prevailing. Which leades us to the third buſineſſe, to the application; in a double uſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Application is;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To condemne the folly and injuſtice, of ſuch as contemn or neglect, ſo powerfull a Dutie. There are curſed <hi>Edomites</hi> that ſay of <hi>Ieruſalem, Downe with it, downe with it even to the ground:</hi> and doe envie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of <hi>Sion.</hi> Faſting and prayers build up a wall, but the <hi>Horonite,</hi> the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> and the <hi>Arabian, Sanballat, Tobiah,</hi> and <hi>Geſhem,</hi> laugh at the worke, and labour to hinder it. There are ſome that dare ſay; <hi>What needes this adoe? Wherefore are theſe intended aſſemblings?</hi> Thus they oppoſe their owne ſafetie, and endeavour againſt that with which God both is pleaſed, and pacified. Nay, ſome are ſo mad; that, wee uſe for a remedie or preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they eſteeme and accuſe as the meanes to bring in the peſtilence. How farre at length will the malice of Satan extend? But the Papiſts take us off from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, while they tell us, wee are fitter to ward, then giue the blow: They accuſe us, as in our doctrines and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19096:27"/> practiſe, enemies to faſting. Vnjuſt ſlanders! For our doctrine, let them heare it, and ſee what they can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Beſides what hath beene ſaid, let them heare him whom profeſſedly they are wont to oppoſe, <hi>Calvin,</hi> in the fourth Booke of his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> in the twefth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Seeing faſting is an holy exerciſe, why ſhould wee leſſe uſe it, then of old they uſed in like neceſſitie?</hi> Wee reade, not onely that the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Church, which was framed and conſtitute by the word of God, but alſo the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> who had no other preaching but that of <hi>Ionah;</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in ſigne of ſorrow: What reaſon is there, we ſhould not doe the like? But tis an outward Ceremony which together with others tooke end in Chriſt. Nay, but at this day, (as it alwayes was) it is a profitable helpe to the faithfull, and an uſefull admonition to the awakening of themſelues, leſt with their too much ſecuritie and ſloath, they more and more provoke God. Wee aſſent to the very words of that great <hi>Calvin.</hi> What can be more expreſſe? more plaine? But they cavill at our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. Wee receiue it not as a part of Religion, and accidentarily onely religious: and conſidered ſolitary and by it ſelfe, we count it either no way pertaining to Religion, or if pertaining, (becauſe it reſpects the body onely) ſuperſtitious. Such are the Popiſh; wee reject them, and juſtly becauſe ſo: yet from hence is the ground of their ſlander. But doe we condemne faſting, becauſe we condemne theirs? The holy Chriſtians of old, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the faſts of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Marcionits,</hi> yet were not enemies to Faſting. But ſlanderous are the mouths of <hi>Salmero</hi> and that <hi>Teaſty Coſter,</hi> who teach their abuſed people, That as the Devill, (who knowes that all ſorts of Devills are caſt out by prayer &amp; faſting) labours by all meanes to rob Chriſtians of thoſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; ſo the Hereticks (ſo he is pleaſed to brand us) oppoſe faſting as a ſuperſtitious thing, contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and divine will. They are the words of that foule Ieſuit. You ſaw all the ground before: But whither
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19096:28"/> will not impatiency the daughter of prejudice carrie men? This for our doctrine; concerning our practiſe they are more impudent. They ſay wee plead onely for the fleſh, and pleaſe our bellyes: That we giue our ſelues to ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, neglecting faſting. Ah <hi>Beloved!</hi> let me by the way complaine, before I make Apologie. How doe our ſinnes riſe to our ſhame, that the Adverſaries take ſuch notice of them? Oh that our carriage were ſo holy, that our liues might be our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to proue the truth of what wee doe profeſſe! Your profaneneſſe and irreligion, weakens our diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings againſt Popiſh ſuperſtitions. But chiefly let me entreat you of this Pariſh, (who liue mixt with ſo many Papiſts, as no where more in the whole Countie) let me entreat you to apprehend it, leſt your profanenes ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them in their errors, and weaken me in the end of my preaching. Let them take no notice of your oaths, your reelings, your diſorders, your profanations of the Lords day: your thronged Ale-houſes, your unwatchfull behaviours make your Popiſh neighbours to deſpiſe our Religion, and the common Goſpell. But though I accuſe you from the Pulpit, I may dare notwithſtanding to plead againſt the enemy; There can be no prejudice to our doctrine, though the liues of our people, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable to what wee teach them. But againe, if we compare with theirs, I may defend and preferre our owne practiſe. Why are they blind? Why are they wilfully blind, to their owne ſhame? They allow, nay, they appoint ſet <hi>Bacchanalls.</hi> And for their faſting, there remaines among them but a meere ſhadow of it. That you may ſee, I neither malice nor belie them; take it from the Pen of their owne <hi>Pereſius, Holy Faſts are in uſe amongst us, onely according to a certaine outward Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; for wee thinke we faſt, if but once a day wee dine, though even unto ſurfeit, well tipled and better cramm'd; taking meat not onely for the ſuſtaining of nature, or onely for one day, but in ſuch a quantitie, as might for three dayes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19096:28"/> ſuffice that famed Milo. I ſpeake not of the qualitie and difference of your meats and ſawces: For now, neither the Sea, the earth, the ayre, nor Fiſh-mongers can ſatisfie our appetite.</hi> A fit zeale of a Papiſt againſt Papiſts. But he goes farther: <hi>And,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it were more tollerable, if the Laicks were onely thus diſeaſed, but it hath crept up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many Prieſts of our order, upon religious orders, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of our Church; whom I ſee ſo ſtudious of this matter, that you may rather ſay, they were borne to devoure, then to imitate the Apoſtolique modeſtie; to the deceiving of the poore, and the deſtruction of their chaſtitie, which together with holy Faſts, hath ſeemed to haue forſaken the earth.</hi> A fitter zeale of a Ieſuit againſt his owne ſhaue-lings. Theſe are Papiſts; theſe are their Faſts: Now let them if they can triumph. Thus being rid of them, I might renew the application, but I proceed to a ſecond.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us be exhorted, becauſe it is ſo powerfull a meanes, to make uſe of it. Neglect not ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: Let us vſe it in any kinde of neede. In the evill of ſinne; if wee would gaine power againſt any luſt, if ſtrength againſt any corruption, if worke out any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall diſeaſe; haue recourſe unto this remedie. I thinke it is <hi>Ambroſe</hi> that notes it from the <hi>Naturaliſts; That the faſting ſpittle of a man kills a Serpent;</hi> His alluſion is apt, this deſtroyes the power of the Devill. Prayer is as the ſpittle, but it muſt be faſting: And our Saviour tells his Diſciples upon occaſion of a man poſſeſſed brought to be cured, <hi>That this kinde of Devill goes not out but by faſting and prayer.</hi> Let us uſe it alſo in the evill of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>So ſtand in the Gap:</hi> This courſe <hi>Ninivie</hi> tooke; <hi>Let neither man nor beaſt taſte any thing, let them be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſackcloth, and cry mightily unto the Lord; And God repented of the evill that he ſaid he would doe unto them, and he did it not. Ion.</hi> 3, 8.9.10. When the newes came that the multitude was in <hi>Hazazon-Tamar, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat feared, and ſet himſelfe to ſeeke the Lord, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a faſt.</hi> Then <hi>Iehaziel</hi> brings a better newes from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19096:29"/> the Lord, <hi>Be not diſmaid at this great multitude, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell is not yours but Gods.</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.3.15. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. Let us uſe it alſo for the obtaining of good. The tender and true-affected <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that for the turning away of reproach from the deſolated <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he might gaine favour in the ſight of <hi>Artaxerxes, faſts and prayes. Neh.</hi> 1.4.11. When favour was obtained and a journey granted, <hi>Ezra</hi> profeſſeth he gained ſafe-conduct from God; <hi>So we faſted and beſought our God for this, and he was entreated of us, Ezr.</hi> 8.23. Wee may be aſſured ſome way to prevaile; <hi>When wee come to God, we muſt beleeue that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeeke him: Heb.</hi> 11.6. Wee haue a promiſe to giue us that aſſurance; <hi>When thou faſteſt be not as the hypocrites, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly: Mat.</hi> 6.18. How ever wee ſhall haue the <hi>marke,</hi> and God ſhall challenge us his; <hi>Eze.</hi> 9.4.6.</p>
               <p>Oh ſet upon the Dutie, thus we may be helpfull to the Church. Men be differently helpfull, according to their different advantages; ſome haue the advantage of ſtrength, and may helpe with their Armes, ſome of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; may helpe with their purſes, ſome of wiſedome, and may helpe with their counſells; This is the common advantage, &amp; all may be helpfull. Let us joyne our hands, and unite our flames; the fire will be more forcible; and the burthen more eaſily remooved: Iudgement is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then which lyes upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Country, that burthen which one cannot moue, many hands may caſt off; helpe to unload the Country, and the rather becauſe the Devill ſtriues to ſtrike away our hold, and to hinder our indevours this way; When <hi>Ieſchuah</hi> ſtands before the Lord, Satan ſtands on his right hand to reſiſt him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1.

                  </gap> of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a Torch, is very expreſſiue to denote the qua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie of our Watch. But the word in the Text, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is ſuch a Watch as ſignifies wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. <hi>Be awake, and open-eyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To whom the Exhortation is given;</p>
               <p n="1">1. More ſtrictly; <hi>What I ſay to you;</hi> that referres to the third verſe, the company that was preſent, <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Andrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. More largely; <hi>What I ſay to you, I ſay to all;</hi> either all the Apoſtles, as ſome Expoſitors, or all people, as moſt and the <hi>Interlineary Gloſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. How the Exhortation is inferred, in the firſt word, <hi>But</hi> or <hi>And;</hi> which referres to a double argument;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The uncertaine houre of the Maſters comming, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 34.35.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:19096:30"/>2. The certaine danger of ſecure ſleeping, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>It needs not a farther diviſion nor explication, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither confuſion nor difficulty; but yeelds in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall order theſe foure Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Watching is Gods Ordinance, and our dutie. Tis grounded at leaſt by intimation, in the Command, <hi>Watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that know Chriſt muſt watch: <hi>What I ſay to you. Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> tho endeared to our Saviour, are not exempt from the Dutie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All muſt doe it; a common both exerciſe and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what to you, I ſay to <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore <hi>they</hi> and <hi>all</hi> muſt <hi>watch,</hi> becauſe of the uncertaintie of time, and the danger of neglect; <hi>And what I ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould treſpaſſe on the time to follow this Method, and therefore ſhall reduce all to one head, and a plainer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is the Dutie of every one to watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture urgeth it: <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.42.43.44. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. It were eaſie to abound in Quotations, a Concordance doth it to our hand. But there are ſome expreſſions in thoſe named places, which ſhew us what it is to watch, yet Ile rather take others. When <hi>Ezra</hi> had weighed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sherebiah, Haſhaebiah,</hi> and their brethren, the ſilver, and gold, and precious veſſels, he giues this charge, <hi>Watch yee and keepe them: Ezr.</hi> 8.29. To watch as wee doe a treaſure, which is worthy of care, and may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by Theft. <hi>Iob</hi> compares the behaviour of the violent, <hi>to wilde Aſſes in the Deſart, who watch to the prey, or riſe betimes for the prey; Iob</hi> 24.5. To watch as the induſtrious doe, who will not loſe the advantage of opportunities. <hi>David</hi> hath it in another ſenſe; <hi>Except the Lord keep the Citie, the watch-man waketh but in voine. Pſal.</hi> 127.1. To watch as they that feare the Invaſion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19096:30"/> and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>
                  </gap>ult of an enemie. Which differs but in a little from that of our Saviour; <hi>If the Good-man of the houſe had knowne in what Watch the Theife would come, he would haue watched, and not haue ſuffered his houſe to be broken up. Mat.</hi> 24.43. To watch as men that ſtand in feare of ſuddain dangers. The former may haue relation to a man in reſpect of his ſoule, the two latter in reſpect of judgement: To watch our ſelues by carefulneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; To watch the comming of Iudgement by wiſe foreſeeing.</p>
               <p>I entended my ſelfe wholly for the application, in a threefold uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. If it be every ones dutie to watch, it juſtly and ſeaſonably reproues, ſuch as watch not, ſuch as reproach them that watch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It condemnes ſuch as watch not: The careleſſe, and ſecure.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The careleſſe; the careleſſe of their ſoules ſtate; that as if their hearts were of little worth, haue no mind or thought of them. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of the feild of the ſloathfull, that <hi>he paſſed by it, and by the Vineyard of the man voyde of underſtanding, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e, it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                        <desc>…</desc>
                     </gap>ne over with Thornes, and Nettles had covered the face thereof, and the ſtone-wall thereof was broken downe.</hi> Such may our notice be, when our obſervation paſſeth upon ſome men; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with ranker weeds, vices and diſorders which are of an eaſie growth; for they are ſluggards, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Watch. Is the ſoule no more precious? That we beſtow no Culture, no Tillage, no weeding? Men let themſelues roue upon varietie of deceiving objects; and wander as Harlots upon every greene hill. The ſoule in the fallen eſtate is a looſe and ungovernd wanton, yet we are not wary to reſtraine it; and though every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hath a bayte upon it, and a hooke under it, we are careleſſe of the danger. Nay, ſome are growne to ſuch dulneſſe, they excuſe ſinne with ſinne; The ſwearer beats off a ſeaſonable reproofe of his raſh oath, &amp; pleads,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19096:31"/> 
                  <hi>He did ntt heed it.</hi> That plea is an accuſation, the ſinne is doubled; to ſinne, and to be careles how we ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecure. Ah <hi>Beloved,</hi> wee are fallen aſleepe! tis a ſleeping age, a dead ſleepe when calls doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us. A man that ſleepes ſoundly heares not, though the voyce be both ſhrill and neare. God hath cald us, he hath called oft and lowd. While mercies ſpake, he called with a ſweet ſtill voice; now he calls with a voice of Thunder, Iudgement hath a loud peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing voice: yet we heare neither. We ſay we ſhall haue peace, though wee walke in the imaginations of our hearts. But tis an higher madneſſe; when we dare ſay with thoſe in the Prophet; when we threaten judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due and deſerved againſt ſinne, they ſay, <hi>Let him make ſpeed, and haſten his worke that we may ſee it, and let the Councell of the holy One of Iſrael draw nigh that wee may know it: Eſa.</hi> 5.19. But there is a threatning of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible judgement againſt ſuch, and the judgement ſhall be more ſevere, if the threatning be deſpiſed: <hi>If any when he heareth the words of this curſe, ſhall bleſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall haue peace though I walke in the imaginations of my heart, to adde drunkennes to thirſt; the Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoake againſt that man, and all the Curſes that are written in this Booke, ſhall light vpon him, the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord ſhall ſeparate him unto evill: Deut.</hi> 29.19.20.21. God will make the puniſhment ſuiteable to the ſinne; The ſinne of the ſecure is, <hi>They put farre away the evill day,</hi> therefore the puniſhment is fitted; <hi>They ſhall goe captiue, with the firſt that goe captiue: Amos,</hi> 6.3.7. The judgement which ſecuritie puts off, ſhall for that cauſe be brought on with more ſpeed. The like is obſerved by <hi>Eſaiah, Becauſe yee haue ſaid, wee haue made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with death, and with hell are wee at agreement, when the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe thorough, it ſhall not come unto us, for we haue made lyes our refuge, and under falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19096:31"/> haue we hid our ſelues; therefore, the haile ſhall ſweepe away the refuge of lyes, and the waters ſhall overflow the hiding place: Eſa.</hi> 28.15.17. Securitie is contented with weake defences: What ayd can they giue us in the day of viſitation, when Iudgement ſhall be like a ſtorme and flowing tempeſt, bearing downe all before it, much more thoſe trifling Refuges built and ſtrengthened by lyes and falſ-hood. But me-thinkes that of the ſame Prophet ſtrikes with a deeper wound; <hi>The Lord did call to weeping and to mourning, and behold joy and gladneſſe, ſlaying Oxen, and killing ſheepe, eating fleſh, and drinking wine; Let us eate and drinke, for to morrow wee ſhall dye; And it was revealed in mine eares by the Lord of hoſts, ſurely this iniquitie ſhall not be purged from you till you dye, ſayth the Lord of Hoſts: Eſa.</hi> 22.12.13.14. God is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his glory, and will not endure himſelfe abuſed in his goodneſſe and patience. But becauſe ſecuritie is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, if not grounded upon, yet much ſtrengthened by the prophecying of lyes; therefore the threats are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually more ſevere againſt the Prophets, who rocke the Cradle, and lull and ſing the people to their ſleepe. <hi>They haue healed the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlightly, ſaying, peace, peace, when there is no peace; therefore they ſhall fall among them that fall: Ier.</hi> 6.14.15. The Prophet that heales a people truely, makes them ſenſible of the wound; but to pleaſe, is to heale it ſlightly: So ſome doe heale our juſt feares; Alas! ſay they, there is no ſuch cauſe of ſo much feare, all ſhall be well, they are but puling malecontents that talke of dangerous time: But heare their doome; There ſhall be a falling, and <hi>theſe ſhall fall among them that fall.</hi> More largely of this, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.16.17.21.25.26.30.31. And yet more expreſly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.10.11.12.13.14. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It condemnes ſuch as reproach them that Watch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as watch over their liues; theſe reproachers are profeſſed enemies to the abuſed and deſpiſed holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. They call them preciſe, whom they obſerue care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19096:32"/> and entend to blemiſh them with that imputation. Oh what diſcouragements hath Religion now, in a time when Religion is on all hands at leſt ſaluted! And though all know, how men ought to runne, yet they wonder <hi>that we runne not with them into the ſame exceſſe of riot.</hi> This hath ever beene the portion of the Saints; Ile inſtance but in <hi>Davids</hi> Complaint, and in an inſtance fitteſt to the preſent buſineſſe: <hi>When I wept and chaſtned my ſoule with faſting, that was to my reproach, I made ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth alſo my garment, and I became a Proverbe to them; They that ſit in the Gate ſpeake againſt me, and I was the ſong of the drunkards: Pſal.</hi> 69.10.11.12. But dare yee oppoſe a knowne goodneſſe? If it be a dutie injoyned, how dare yee, how can yee reproach it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as reproach the watchfull fore-ſeers of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> bare ſuch rebukes; from the injurious blind Courtiers; <hi>The Princes ſaid unto the King, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, let this man be put to death, for thus he weakneth the hands of the men of warre, and the hands of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in ſpeaking ſuch words unto them, for this man ſeeketh not the welfare of the people, but the hurt: Ier.</hi> 38.4. There are ſome that haue the Garb of wiſe ones, that cavill at our plaine and neceſſary preachings, and endure not our fore-warnings of the people. Theſe ſpeeches, ſay they, breed feares and diſcouragements to ſad and diſquiet the mindes of people; and this is to ſeeke their hurt, rather then welfare, by weakning their hands. But how can they be weakened by being forewarned; rather, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is never ſo ſtrong, as when it ſees it ſelfe weake, and is kindly humbled. Tis likely the prophane and al-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die drowned Inhabitants of the <hi>old world,</hi> mockt at the provident <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp; wondred to ſee him ſpend ſo much both time and coſt, in building ſo ſtrange a Veſſell; but he ſaw and provided againſt the Floud.

This frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? The plague is farre enough from us; or if nearer, yet why all theſe proviſions? They are unjuſt murmurs of men blinded, and not able to diſcerne Gods wayes. But the Scripture doomes them: <hi>Becauſe yee haue ſet at nought all my Counſells, I alſo will laugh at your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie; I will mocke when your feare commeth; when your feare commeth as deſolation, and your deſtruction commeth as a whirlewinde, when diſtreſſe and anguiſh commeth upon you: Prov.</hi> 1.25.26.27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. The ſecond uſe, is the more cloſe applying of the words of the Text, in a ſerious exhortation; let us, ſince it is our common dutie, be watchfull. The Papiſts wreſt this Scripture to their owne ſuperſtitions, ſo they doe the Exhortation; and upon this, compared with the thirtie-fifth verſe, doe ground their obſervation of their Canonicall houres, and their night-Watches: So they make the thing meerly a Ceremony, and elude the entendment of our Saviours Sermon. The <hi>Iewes</hi> divided their night into foure Quarters, which they called, foure Watches, and every Watch had three houres, the third houre which terminated the reſt, was called, the Watch. The firſt began at Sun-ſet, and ended at the third houre of night; this was called, the beginning of the Watches, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.19. The ſecond began at the third houre, and ended at the ſixt; this was called the middle Watch: <hi>Iud.</hi> 7.19. The third began at ſixt, ended at ninth; was called, the third Watch, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.38. The fourth, beginning at the ninth, ending at the twelfth houre, was called, the morning Watch: <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Mat</hi> 14.25. Theſe had ſometimes other names, as they are all moſt expreſſely mentioned in this Text, 1. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19096:33"/> or in the morning.</hi> Now accordingly the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> beſides the greater houres of the day, obſerues foure Watches of the night; 1. The Veſpertine, at ſixe a clocke at night. 2. The Completory at nine. 3. The Nocturne at mid-night. 4. The Mattins, at three in the morning: But with manifeſt ſuperſtition; as being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contrary to the Rule of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and the rule of our freedome, not to obſerue times. Beſides, <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Francolin, Bellarmine</hi> hath handled the Queſtion ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but we will a while examine how ſtrongly. Firſt, he urgeth the lawfulneſſe and conveniency of thoſe Vigils; from examples in holy Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 62. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.6. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.9. But what will all theſe places proue, but what wee eaſily grant them? both that tis very imitable to be much in prayer, and that the <hi>Iewes</hi> had ſuch a diſtinction of time. You may conferre the Scriptures, and ſaue me ſo eaſie a labour, and finde that no more can be drawne from them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that place any ſtronger, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.1. That <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> went into the Temple <hi>at the houre of prayer, being the ninth houre.</hi> For, (beſides that <hi>Druſius</hi> hath noted it out of <hi>David Kimchi,</hi> that the <hi>Iewes</hi> had but three houres of prayer, which at leaſt giues a Touch upon and againſt their obſervation:) <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> entended not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the evening Sacrifice, which by the true paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall was aboliſhed; therefore though the ninth houre, were the houre of prayer to the ſtill-blind <hi>Iewes,</hi> yet not to them: or, to draw the moſt from it; we will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it profitable for Chriſtians, that ſome ſet houres be appointed certaine for the better aſſembling together; yet wee reject them, as we know the Papiſts meane them, as neceſſary and parts of divine worſhip. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he alledgeth the teſtimony of ſome Fathers: but though my few yeares haue afforded me but ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with their writings, yet I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue; That moſt of them, while they ſeeme to intimate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19096:33"/> ſome ſet times then in uſe, yet they purpoſe onely the commendation of frequencie in prayer. So St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as much as any verſed in the externall of worſhip, yet driues but at this, the continuance of our devotion, <hi>Qui autem &amp;c.</hi> But we that are in Chriſt, that is, alwayes in the light, let us not in the night times ceaſe from prayer. And what elſe is in that rule of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> concerning the ſixe times of prayer, when we riſe, goe abroad, before dinner, after, in the even, at our bed time: but that any voyde of ſuperſtition may admit of? Nor is there much more, in St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> either in his funerall prayſes of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> or in his directiue Epiſtle to <hi>Laeta,</hi> for the inſtituting of her daughter: or if more may be found in any, wee may without much wrong to thoſe Ancients whom we honour, impute it to ſuperſtition which crept on faſt in thoſe times. But thirdly, he preſents his reaſons: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unworthy the learning of ſo famed a Scholler. 1. The Watches are on Ternaries of houres, (all the third houres, which terminate the Watches being called the greater houres) and this in the honour of the glorious Trinitie. But what can be more vaine, then to trifle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip with numbers? 2. The nocturnes are to ſignifie the future reſurrection, which ſhall be in the night. We grant, 'twere pious to be much in ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but there is no ground to ſeparate ſet time unto it. 3. They boaſt of this as ſtrongeſt; That theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the memory of our Redemption They inſtance chiefly from <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> (if that were his) in his booke of <hi>Virginitie: Learne the Pſalter and the Pſalmes; let the riſing Sunne ſee that Booke in thy hand.</hi> In that manner he proceeds, to ſet them on prayers and prayſes; after the third houre, becauſe then the Croſſe was brought, at the ſixt, becauſe then Chriſt was lift upon the Croſſe; at the ninth, becauſe then he dyed. Well, admit the rule were his, might not <hi>Athanaſius</hi> be ſuperſtitious? might not <hi>Baſil?</hi> might not <hi>Caſſianus?</hi> Why doe they obtrude upon us from humane authoritie, what the Scripture-Canon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19096:34"/> builds not? I might make you merry with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument, yet the Ieſuit delivers it ſoberly, and perhaps beleeues it; That an Angel gaue the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome Canonicall houres to ſome devout ones. And that in <hi>Diocleſians</hi> perſecution, a celeſtiall pſalmody was heard at thoſe Canonicall vigils, about the reliques of ſome Martyrs. It is wonder, that <hi>Iohn Cocklaeus,</hi> put not theſe into his Manuſcript <hi>Amalarius,</hi> eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelfe the command of ſuch a Print-houſe? But I keepe you too long upon this diſcourſe; but having clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the way, I may better goe on, to the Exhortation as the Text meanes it, according as the Doctrine was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, <hi>To be watchfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning our ſelues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the approach of Iudgements.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning our ſelues; let us be watchfull over our better parts, our ſoules; let us obſerue to keepe the precepts diligently, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.4.5. and to keepe our hearts with all diligence; <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſeemes to allude to ſuch a Watch as is over a beſieged Citie, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, 1. All that enter, what, whence they are. This muſt be our care to keepe the Ports and Entrances of the ſoule. Every ſenſe is a ſeverall gate, and by every one the enemy may be admitted; enticements may paſſe through the eye, by the eare ſuggeſtions; and by the ſmell, touch, and taſte, what may eaſily infect the heart. Oh keepe the portalls cloſed, and with that holy <hi>Iob,</hi> let our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants keepe the Watch; <hi>I haue made a Covenant with mine eye, why then ſhould I thinke upon a mayd? Iob</hi> 31.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All that goe abroad; attend our cogitations, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, actions: There may be treaſonable practiſes fom within; thoſe are the Inhabitants, if they be falſe, let them not goe abroad to betray our peace. Therefore the ſame <hi>Salomon,</hi> when he exhorts to keepe the heart, he would not haue us neglect the mouth, the lips, the feet; <hi>Keepe thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life; put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19096:34"/> lips farre from thee. Prov.</hi> 4.23.24.25.26.27. <hi>David</hi> knew ſuch dangers, and reſolues, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1.2. <hi>I will take heed to my wayes, that I ſinne not with my tongue, I will keepe my mouth with a Bridle.</hi> The greateſt enemie is within; The inſide doth undoe us. There muſt be that double Watch, of ſuch as enter from without, of ſuch as from within depart from us; to keepe the heart from extravagancies, and the enemie from approaches: for when nature and occaſion meet together, they never meet without ſome harme; like two luſtfull wantons equally heated, they depart not without infection. And therefore as we muſt be watchfull over, ſo we may pray againſt our ſelues, and ſing his <hi>Letanie, A me, me ſalve, Domine;</hi> Lord keepe me from my ſelfe. Giue me leaue to preſſe this firſt part of the Exhortation with ſome motives; 'Tis convenient, neceſſary, profitable; the contrary is dangerous, of theſe foure but briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is convenient we ſhould be watchfull; conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in reſpect of our ſo many relations. 1. We are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and tis a convenient thing for Paſtors to attend their flockes. When the Angel-like newes was brought, <hi>the Shepheards were abiding in the fields, keeping Watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their flocke by night: Luk.</hi> 2.8. Every man's a paſtor. The King hath a larger fold, ſo haue Magiſtrates accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as ſtationed, ſo haue Miniſters in their Cures: And every one, though of hid condition, and not ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne to any, yet hath a flocke. All men haue ſoules to attend; the ſoule is the flocke, though we ſtand in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relation. 2. We are warriours, and 'tis convenient for Souldiers to feare and attend the onſet. The <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> that lay in Campe, had ſet the Watch; <hi>Iud.</hi> 7.19. Our enemy will waite the opportunitie of a ſleeping Camp. 3. Wee are Sentinells; their name is from their Watch: we muſt be <hi>extra cubantes,</hi> and being Scout-Watches may not keepe our beds. 4. We are ſervants; tis fit for ſuch to attend their Maſters eye and command. Let us with <hi>Samuel,</hi> riſe from the place where wee are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19096:35"/> layd downe to ſleepe, and be ready to anſwere; <hi>Speake Lord, for thy ſervant heareth.</hi> 5. Wee are infirme by Lethargie; Waking muſt be our Cure, and therefore convenient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is neceſſary wee ſhould be watchfull; neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1. Becauſe our Tenements are ruinous. Wee would feare to lodge in weake tottering buildings, chiefly in tempeſtuous bluſtring nights, leſt our covering might bury us with the fall. Theſe carcaſſes which wee carrie with us, are ſuch weake buildings, <hi>earthly Tabernacles,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>houſes made of Clay, Iob</hi> 4.19. and are eaſily blowne downe. Wee haue ſeene ſtrong able bodies cruſhed with a little ſickneſſe, and ſome whom a few ſits of an Ague haue blowne into the graue. Let us watch againſt the ſtorme, that unprovided and on a ſudden we be not over-whelmed and covered with our owne duſt. 2. As our Tenements are ruinous, ſo wee know not our Land-Lords day. For our habitations here, wee know the date and period of our leaſes; but of our life wee know not. That leaſe, if it be one, which God hath ſeemd to make generall, is but a ſhort one; <hi>The dayes of our yeares are threeſcore yeares and ten, if by reaſon of ſtrength they be foureſcore yeares, yet is their ſtrength labour and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: for it is ſoone cut off, and wee flie away. Pſal.</hi> 90.10. But we haue no leaſe, but are at will, and in a moment may be cut off from the Land of the living.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is profitable we ſhould be watchfull; after the Vigil is the feſtivall day; and Bleſſedneſſe is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuch, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.37. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom the Lord when he commeth, ſhall finde watching.</hi> And there is Bleſſedneſſe too, <hi>in via,</hi> while wee watch, wee haue the company of our Lord; God is preſent, the Spirit is preſent with them that wake. You know, ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping admits not of company, though an hundred lodge in the ſame roome, and all ſleepe; though the place be full, they are all alone: but company is to them that wake, becauſe waking makes uſe of company. When
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19096:35"/> we are unwatchfull, God is gone; but when we watch, Chriſt watcheth with us, or we with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. <hi>Tarry here, and watch with mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Not to be watchfull is full of danger. We are neare the enemy, his onſets are readie: <hi>that roaring Lyon goes about ſeeking whom he may devoure:</hi> and when aſleepe, we lye open to invaſion. When the <hi>Amalekites</hi> were careleſly eaſing themſelues, <hi>David</hi> overtooke them with a bloudy ſlaughter; So did <hi>Laban Iacob, on mount Gilead, in monte deliciarum;</hi> upon the hill of pleaſures; as <hi>Ierom</hi> renders it, at leſt wittily if not fitly. While wee ſcatter our ſelues upon Temptations, wee are ſnared by them; and therefore muſt ſpecially be carefull, that wee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not upon the green hills.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other part of the Exhortation is, <hi>That we would be watchfull concerning the Approach of Iudgements.</hi> We will lay this ground, and you cannot deny it, <hi>That there may be a knowledge of evill comming on.</hi> The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, there may be a <hi>fore-warning to flee from the wrath to come: Mat.</hi> 3.7. So our Saviour Argues; <hi>When it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, yee ſay it will be faire weather, for the skie is red; and in the morning, it will be foule weather to day, for the skie is red and lowring: O yee hypocrites, yee can diſcerne the face of the skie, but can yee not diſcerne the ſignes of the times? Mat.</hi> 16.2.3. Looke up, looke up, <hi>Beloved;</hi> can yee diſcerne nothing? doe yee not perceiue a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring skie? doe yee not ſee, how ſome blacke Clouds ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and threaten a ſtorme? Godly men haue ever had ſharpe eyes, and haue fore-ſeene evills. <hi>The rod of the Almond tree; and the ſeething pot from toward the North,</hi> are both beheld by <hi>Ieremiah.</hi> Ah! wee ſee what wee tremble at; and if you inquire, <hi>What wee ſee;</hi> I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to ſpend the remainder of the time, to helpe you in your Watch, by diſcovery of ſuch ſignes by which you may judge of a comming Evill.</p>
               <p>Signes are of two ſorts:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Extraordinary; then is God wont to preach reall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19096:36"/> Sermons; and Chriſt ſpeakes of ſuch, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.25. I might inſtance in this kinde, thoſe knowne examples of <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> warning; The ayery apparitions, the voice <hi>Migremus hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>c,</hi> the iterated woe proclaimed by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſonne; but they are knowne Stories, and therefore, (though God alſo hath afforded us ſome ſuch witneſſes in our owne Land and time) Ile not deferre you, from matter more profitable, becauſe more ordinary.</p>
               <p>Two ordinary ſignes, theſe Ile reduce to two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The joynt warning by the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe grounds from whence they take their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The joynt conſent of the holy Miniſtry in giving warning, is an aſſured argument that warning had need be given. There runnes the veine of the propheticke ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit through the holy Miniſtry. This is Gods ordinance; for thus hath the Lord ſaid, <hi>Goe ſet a watchman, let him declare what he ſeeth.</hi> If wee aske: behold he ſees <hi>a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret with a couple of horſemen;</hi> and hee hearkens diligently with much heed; <hi>he cryes, a lyon, a lyon: I ſtand continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the watch tower in the day time, I am ſet in my ward whole nights; and behold here commeth a charet with a couple of horſemen. Eſay</hi> 21.6, 7, 8, 9. God ſtill hath provided theſe Sentinells and Trumpets: <hi>Noah</hi> warded in the old world, before the floud; <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodome:</hi> The Miniſters now. God hath fulfilled the promiſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 62.6. <hi>I haue ſet watchmen vpon thy walls oh Ieruſalem, which ſhall never hold their peace, day nor night.</hi> Will yee not attend to the viſion of your <hi>Seers?</hi> To the trumpets of your Watchmen? When the Watchman that ſtood on the Tower of <hi>Iezreel,</hi> had ſpyed the marching of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi> and cryed, <hi>I ſee a Company, Ioram</hi> takes warning, and ſends out an Horſeman, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.17. So <hi>David</hi> beleeves the voice from aboue the gate; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.24, 25, 26. Why are we entruſted by God with ſuch ſacred diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, if we may not be credited by you? Are we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull or unskilfull, that yee misdoubt the notice? We
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19096:36"/> either are, or ſhould be higher, then the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore may ſee farther; climing often up to the mount of contemplation, and being much in prayer. This ſigne none but may obſerue, for the mourning voice of <hi>Turtles</hi> is every where heard: from the pulpits of godly Preachers in every corner of the Land, wee are made acquainted, that ſome wrath may bee expected. Can we thinke ſo generall and full a conſent of united voices portends nothing? If we ſhould ſee one fired Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, wee would miſtruſt ſomewhat, but when everie where that we turne our eyes, we ſhould behold thoſe blazings, it would make us tremblingly feare Invaſion. Beloved, the Beacons round about are ſet on fire, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers flame from their pulpits; ſome enemy is ready to enter upon us. This were enough notice, if we were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough obedient: yet that your ſecuritie may bee yet more removed, you ſhall ſee the ſecond ſigne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The grounds from whence they take their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings which they giue to you; I might name many, but will onely inſiſt on fiue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ground. Iudgment is ſuteable unto ſinne, but may chiefly be expected, when ſuch ſinnes abound, as haue the direct rule of Counter-paſſion. See the rule cleared by an Inſtance: <hi>Mich.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>What is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Iacob? Is it not Samaria? Therefore I will make Samaria as an heape of the field: all ſhall be burnt with fire, for ſhee gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the hire of an harlot.</hi> We find then that in Idolatry is the rule of Counter-paſſion, therefore Idolatry will bring deſtruction. There are ſome ſinnes left to <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> to the revenge of a ſeverer juſtice; and God threatens to retaliate. Their ſinne was in <hi>Samaria,</hi> the high places; and <hi>Samaria</hi> their ſtrength ſhall be overthrowne. They were adulterous and looſed in their affection to God, they encreaſed in thoſe braveries, which were provided by their Idolatry as the hire of an harlot, therefore they ſhall be made nothing, of ſo little worth and value, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19096:37"/> the contemptible hire of an harlot. Againe, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>I haue heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they haue reproached my people: This ſhall they haue for their pride, becauſe they haue reproached, and magnified themſelues againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord of hoſts; Surely Moab ſhall be as Sodome, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah.</hi> We find againe that in the pride of a Kingdome, is the direct rule of Counter-paſſion, and therefore a ſuteableneſſe to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. T'is a very profitable worke, when Preachers collect out ſuch ſinnes, as haue beene puniſht in other times and people, to make compariſon and application to ours; but eſpecially this way is moſt convincing, when ſuch ſinnes are propoſed as haue this rule expreſſe vpon them. God make vs ſenſible of what ſinnes wee may find among our ſelues, and may juſtly and truely read vnto vs our owne doome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ground. Mercies abuſed are warning-peices of ſeveritie. All ſinnes offend God, this diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours him more directly; then he proceeds with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with that fury which abuſed patience is wont to turne unto. I might be plentifull in the inſtances of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, for God hath afforded plentie, and our abuſes of them, are as frequent as his bounties. Your owne obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations may ſtore you with thoughts in this kind, and therefore I rather leave it, to proceed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ground. The offers and ſhewes of judgements are the Trumpets of following judgement. Leſſer judgements without repentance, threaten grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So <hi>Aegypts</hi> plagues were methoded; God went in ſteppings, till that fatall night when every houſe ſent out a corſe to an untimely and lamented buriall. In that threatning, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yee ſhall ſee the path, and order of Gods journey. <hi>I will breake the pride of your power, and make you few in number, your wayes ſhall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate:</hi> but if you will not be reformed for theſe, <hi>I will puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſinnes; then I will bring
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19096:37"/> a ſword, which ſhall avenge the quarrell of my Covenant; And if yee will not for all this hearken, I will walke contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to you in fury, and will puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſinnes.</hi> God hath begun in his way, yee may perceiue the foot-ſteps where he hath trod; in the touches and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movalls of almoſt every ordinary judgement. Famine is a great judgement; there was this laſt yeare an offer of that, though in this Northerne part we felt it not ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly; in other places, the faces of the poore children began to gather blackneſſe, and children cryed, bread, bread, when there was none to be broken to them: but this is now removed. Peſtilence is a great judgement, there hath beene divers yeares together offers of that; it is ſtill carried vp and downe, as being Gods viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and removing Campe: but this, at leaſt from our chiefe City, is removed. Home-bred Conſpiracie, is a great judgement; there haue beene many offers of this: witneſſe the treacheries and contrivings of the <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> the Incendiaries of the State in the time of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and our late famed King: but this, or atleaſt we hope it, is removed. Civill State-earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes is a great judgement; beſides former lamented times, there was an offer of this, this very Summer in the begun inſurrection of the <hi>Weſternes:</hi> but God was favourable to the Goſpell, and this is removed. Forraign hoſtile Invaſion is a great judgement; there was an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of this in the proud Armado from <hi>Spaine,</hi> which themſelues untowardly chriſtned <hi>Invincible:</hi> but this by Gods breathing was removed. What need I wearie you, with the remembrance of our frequent Rebellions, of our bloudy civill warres, of our <hi>Rome-bred</hi> treaſons, of that helliſh powder-plot, of your owne late feares the boldneſſe of the common enemy on theſe neighbour Seas, the <hi>Weſterne</hi> Seas, and the frighted ſtate of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhore? All ſhew that God intends to viſit, being ſo often comming on. They are like the offers and flouriſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Duell; but are ſuch remoues, as doe argue a ſtroake,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19096:38"/> though with an unwilling hand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth ground. Wee may feare judgement, when we ſeeke God for the prevention, and reſt in the worke done. Tis that haply which you will not eaſily admit, that ſeeking God ſhould be the way to loſe him; But ſee it confirmd and cleared in the Prophet; <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.10, 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c. They haue loved to wander, they haue not refrained their feete, the Lord doth not accept them:</hi> There is the ground, now heare the cenſure; <hi>When they faſt, I will not heare their cry, and when they offer burnt offerings and an oblation I will not accept them, but I will conſume them by the ſword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</hi> Who doth not wonder at ſuch dealing? Will God deſtroy them that faſt, and ſeeke him in his owne ordinance? Who would not diſpute it, and complaine with <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah? Ah Lord God! behold the Prophets ſay unto them, ye ſhall not ſee the ſword, but I will giue you aſſured peace.</hi> Who thinkes not, but the Prophets might well conclude that to the peoples comfort? But ſaith the Lord, doe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets giue them ſuch aſſurance? <hi>The Prophets prophecie lyes in my name, I ſent them not, neither haue I commanded them; they prophecie the deceit of their heart, by ſword and famine ſhall thoſe Prophets be conſumed.</hi> A heavie doome! Who ſhall haue encouragement hereafter to come unto thee, if they that humble themſelues before thee be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? But let us not plead, for God is juſt. They faſt, but they loue to wander, they haue not refrained their feete. If they had ſought rightly they ſhould haue been accepted; but now reſting in the worke, they rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, then prevent their feare. It is our caſe, we ſettle our ſelues too much on the performance; when we haue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated a day to more ſolemne humiliation, wee thinke we haue done enough: and are careleſſe of the after du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But this is to mocke God, and God, becauſe moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, will be more terrible. So it comes to paſſe, the day and buſineſſe which wee intend for removall, brings a more aſſured ſigne of approach. Oh, thinke not that it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19096:38"/> ſufficeth to haue faſted, unleſſe the feete be refrained from wandring.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt ground which I purpoſe to preſent unto you, from whence you may take notice of approaching evill, is, the with-drawing of Gods preſence from us. When God is pleaſed with a place or people, he ſhewes his preſence there; <hi>He went before Iſrael in a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night,</hi> to direct and ſafe-conduct them in their journey. But when God had ſaid, <hi>I will not goe up in the midſt of thee;</hi> the people mourned at theſe evill tydings. Wee may beſt finde, when Gods preſence is with-drawne, by acquaintance with the ſignes of his preſence.</p>
               <p>The moſt ordinary, are the word and Sacraments du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightly adminiſtred; thus wee haue what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in: but to deale more particularly, I ſhall inſtance unto you foure other ſignes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where God affords his preſence, there is his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the ordinances; a converting power accompanies the preaching of the word. But when the word is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power, or men are rather made worſe by preaching of it; then God is with-drawing himſelfe, and a ſtorme followes. Behold, their eare is uncircumciſed, and they cannot hearken; <hi>Behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach, they haue no delight in it, therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord, I am weary with holding in, I will poure it out: Iere.</hi> 6.10.11. Oh! tis the joynt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Miniſters every where faithfull and painefull, that they find not that ſpirit, and life, and powerfulneſſe in the ordinance; but men hearing, heare not, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the word, and few or none are converted by it; which occaſions their feare, that God purpoſes to bee gone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where Gods preſence is, there is abundance of ſanctifying knowledge; ſo the Covenant is, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. <hi>They ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; for they ſhall all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19096:39"/> know me from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But now wee are either generally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or unſanctified in our knowledge. The common number, though after ſo much light, ſo many meanes, are yet as brutes before God; <hi>Surely, they are poore, they are fooliſh, for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgement of their God. Ier.</hi> 5.4. The Gentry that are heightend by education, yet are generally skild onely in the language of an horſe or dog, but are ſtrangers unto ſaving myſteries. And for ſuch as doe know much, how little doe they know of Chriſt; while ſtudious to ſpend their ſearches, upon things rather curious than neceſſary? May wee not feare, that the houſe exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the hills ſhall be removed? Becauſe the Nations flow not to it; nor according to the promiſe, ſay; <hi>Come, let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, and he will teach us of his wayes: Eſa.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods preſence is attended by Holineſſe with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. When a Church is in the flouriſh, (as a Church doth ever flouriſh, while the Beames or <hi>Radij</hi> of divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence are direct,) Holineſſe hath a freſh beautie, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie doth attend on Holineſſe; <hi>The Wolfe and the Lambe feed together, and the Lyon eates ſtraw like the Bullocke.</hi> The united ſpirits of the faithfull meet with the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection at the ſame worſhip, and as they ſerue one God, they ſerue him with one heart. But we can now better lament, than remedy the want of theſe. Deſpiſed holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is embraced by few, and by them fearefully, not with a daring fore-head: and though men know it ſafe, to be holy, they thinke it a reproachfull thing to be counted holy. But beſides our diſtraction is as generall as our profaneneſſe; men that dare kneele upon the ſame threſhold to beg mercy, are yet voyde of mercy to one another. Loue, Chriſtian loue, ſpirituall loue, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly wanting. I would this Citie of yours did not witneſſe it: that your now cuſtomary and almoſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized ſidings did not fill your Preachers mouths with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19096:39"/> complainings, ſometimes their eyes with teares. But 'tis the diſeaſe of every place, and can wee looke, that the holy God ſhould abide with contemners of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? That <hi>the God of peace</hi> ſhould ſtay with us, when we agree not with our ſelues?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, that I name no more, nor too much weary you; God manifeſts his preſence by his protection of a people, he ſpreads his garment over them for their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. Heretofore we haue beene the gaze of other Nations, all ſtood admiring at our peace, that we might ſing that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 76.1. with but the change of names; In <hi>England is God knowne; His name is great in our Brittiſh Iſles.</hi> Wee, we were long under the wing; but of late we haue found, that God is much gone from us; Wee haue not ſeene him in our Councells, in our Armyes, But I loue not to preſſe with an hard finger upon a ſore; onely would entreat wee would make uſe of theſe obſervations. Step out, ſee what yee can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, whether yee can yet diſcerne the ſtorme: Ile deale as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, for <hi>I heare a ſound of abundance of raine:</hi> let mee deſire you; <hi>Goe up now, looke toward the Sea:</hi> Is there nothing? Goe againe, againe ſeven times, be much in obſervation, frequent in watchfulneſſe. Can yee at length ſee the <hi>little Cloud out of the Sea like a mans hand?</hi> That is warning enough: The heavens will ſoone grow blacke with Clouds and winde; prepare the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, haſt, that the raine ſtop not. If we finde a ſigne, though but a little Cloud; let us make uſe of that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by our watchfulneſſe, labour to eſcape, and be hid with God. Why doe yee ſit ſtill? <hi>Aſſemble your ſelues, and let us enter into the defenced Cities; Ier.</hi> 8.14. Let us make uſe of our priviledge; If a ſtorme riſe, God blowes it; and there is ſhelter onely in God. <hi>Are there any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the vanities of the Gentiles that can cauſe raine?</hi> or can the heavens giue ſhowers? <hi>Art not thou he O Lord our God? Therefore we will waite upon thee, for thou haſt made all theſe things. Ier.</hi> 14.22. Be watchfull, be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19096:40"/> ſee the Approaches: But to what end, if we cannot eſcape? But watchfulneſſe is the meanes to eſcape, <hi>to be hid in the day of the Lords anger;</hi> and the beleeving watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full haue eſcaped; ſee the examples of <hi>Noah, Lot,</hi> the <hi>ſigned, Ezek</hi> 9.4. Of <hi>Ieremiah, Ier.</hi> 40.3.4. Of <hi>Ebed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech, Ier.</hi> 39.18. Or though wee may be wrapped in the judgement which we ſee, we ſhall yet be hid from the evill of the judgement; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10. for God hath promiſed a ſpeciall watch; <hi>wee are graven on the palmes of his hand, Eſa.</hi> 49.16. Wee ſhall not be forgotten, wee cannot be loſt. I will not any further lengthen this Exhortation; but end with a third uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Let me apply it, as our Saviour doth, <hi>What I ſay to you, I ſay to all;</hi> let all ſet upon the Dutie, <hi>Watch.</hi> I cannot paſſe without a word in defence of <hi>Brentius,</hi> who juſtly objects that Cuſtome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that not all, but onely their Monkes and Clergie are bound to obſerue (as they ſpeake) the Canonicall houres. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cavills at that objection, and would proue that ſuch onely are to watch; 1. Becauſe ſome are to be ſeparated from other men to preach, why not alſo to watch; chiefly conſidering the people buſied in other occaſions cannot attend it. But his argument manifeſts, that he either underſtands not, or will not, the nature of our holy vigilancy. Though wee grant, Miniſters are more ſpecially, yet all are bound to it, as we haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it. 2. He reaſons by ſimilitude. A Citie hath Sentinells purpoſely appointed; ſo muſt the Church. But the ſimilitude proues nothing: Are not all bound to attend their ſoules, and not to neglect generall care, to keepe off evill, ſo farre as it lyes in our power to prevent by prayer? Ile not ſtay you, to examine <hi>Gratian,</hi> or the Canons of thoſe two Councells, that of <hi>Mentz,</hi> or that other of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, the matter is not worth the ſtay; but will haſten with the method;

               <p n="2">2. To all. 1. Magiſtrates muſt beleeue the warning from the Miniſtery, and being warned, uſe meanes of prevention. 2. All people generally; 1.

In publique; They muſt by geſtures and words giue warning to one another, that the Watch may the better be maintained.

Wee muſt <hi>exhort one another daily, leſt any be hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne, Heb.</hi> 3.13. Wee muſt waken them that ſleepe, that they be not overtaken with the Tempeſt; <hi>What meaneſt thou, O ſleeper? Ariſe call upon thy God: Ion.</hi> 1.6. So <hi>Mordecai</hi> gaue notice to <hi>Eſther,</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> to the <hi>Iewes.</hi> This guard wee muſt put upon the places of our habitation, and it will be more ſafe, then the Warding at your Citie-gates. For this conſcionable practiſe, will be your defence, and ſhall make your Citie ſtrong, like that Citie in the Prophet, <hi>Eze:</hi> 48.30. &amp;c. <hi>There ſhall be ſafetie round about, and upon every Gate ſhall be written, The Lord is there.</hi>

Here is a Parallel; God is at Controverſie with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the reaſon of that Controverſie.</p>
               <p>The Sermon was preached at that time <hi>when bloud touched bloud,</hi> (if we may ſo interpret that phraſe in the ſecond verſe) when they did bandy for the Scepter, and the Kingdome was gamed for by the ſharpeſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; that time, when they waded through the bloud of one another to the Throne: as the Tragicall Hiſtory of <hi>Zachariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah, Pekah, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhea,</hi> is recorded, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.</p>

               <p>'Tis a judiciall Act, the Prophet hath a <hi>faciall office,</hi> and is beſides a pleader, God ſits Iudge, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſentence. The forme of proceeding is like proceſſe eccleſiaſticall; 1. The Citation, verſe the firſt. 2. A threefold accuſation, in the foure firſt verſes. 3. The ſentence given, in the fift and the verſes following.</p>
               <p>But I will not uncover more than I purpoſe to make uſe of, the two firſt verſes:</p>
               <p>In them we haue;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Preface. It is ſome great thing, <hi>Hoſea</hi> entends to deliver, that he uſhers it with ſuch a forme, <hi>Heare the word of the Lord yee Children of Iſrael.</hi> Some Caſuiſts moue the Queſtion, Whether a Preface may be uſed before a Sermon? And anſwere, that ordinarily it is not convenient, as being not valued by Orators more ſolid, as being the emptie brag of men rather glorious than full, as being if beſide the purpoſe, againſt judgement, if agreeing with it, againſt the Rule of Method. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and like not the childiſh flouriſh, when by ſelecting a Proverb, Apophthegme, or Story, men thinke they caſt a better dye and beautie upon the truth to be delivered. That common uſuall way of ſtopping the mouths of Cavillers, by a few ſet ſpeeches, and well compact phraſes, gathered out of witty Poets or applauſiue Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, may haply betray wit, but will together betray a weakneſſe unfit for the Maieſtie of divine doctrine; Chiefly when a Preface is uſed, as a Trumpet before a Puppet-play, the expectation makes it worſe, ſo much the worſe as the Trumpet was lowder. Yet I would not deny briefe and occaſionall inſinuations, fit explications of Connexion and dependancie, and it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull ſometimes <hi>Captare benevolentiam,</hi> to widen the entrance for the meſſage; So doth this Prophet ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make them attent, before he makes them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Sermon. He had argued againſt their ſinne, he had fore-told them of their danger, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſecure, now he Cites them to Gods barre, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19096:42"/> while he calls them <hi>Children of Iſrael,</hi> he ſeaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the memory of the Covenant, that the Preface might render them, not onely attent, but humble. There may be ſometimes a good uſe of Oratory and Preface; St. <hi>Paul beckens with his hand for ſilence,</hi> and the <hi>Liturgie of the primitiue Churches</hi> began with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to moue the people to attend, and continue reverent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Meſſage. In that we conſider theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>Controverſie: Heare yee the word of the Lord, for the Lord hath a Controverſie.</hi> It is not I, but the Lord that expoſtulates with you; There is a ſuite of the Kings peace againſt you.

Gen.</hi> 6.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The partyes in the Controverſie; God with the Inhabitants of the Land. That giues at leaſt an oblique and tacite touch upon their ingratitude, and Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they were ſtill Inhabitants of that Land which they had forfeited.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>That ſinne cauſeth Gods Controverſie with a Land.</p>
               <p>The Scripture abounds in the proofe of this doctrine. <hi>Heare yee, O mountaines, the Lords Controverſie, and yee ſtrong foundations of the earth, for the Lord hath a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with his people, and he will pleade with Iſrael.</hi> But wherefore is the ſuit? or how occaſioned? The Lord doth not quarrel, but their ingratefulneſſe and rebellion, forceth a Complaint: <hi>Oh my people, what haue I done unto thee! and wherein haue I wearied thee? teſtifie againſt me.</hi> Thus we finde <hi>Hoſea's</hi> Sermon in the mouth of <hi>Micah, Mic.</hi> 6.2.3.

But we ſhall ſee it more confirmed, if we touch at the grounds of this Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sinne breakes Covenant, and therefore no wonder
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19096:43"/> it procureth a ſuite. When God Covenants, he Articles with man; He ſets a Law, and Articles for obedience; ſinne is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a tranſgreſſion of Articles, a departure from the Set-Law; and God muſt needs be offended at ſuch a Breach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sinne breakes love-tyes, and when ſacred relations are ſlighted, it not barely occaſions but provokes unto a ſuit. For the bond of friendſhip, for the ſake of a knowne amitie, God would not haue ſinne entertained of his Leaguers: but when ſinne is welcom'd, it ſeparates God; <hi>Your iniquities haue ſeparated between you and your God;</hi> he was you God in an holy relation, but iniquitie hath put a diſtance, he becomes a ſtranger, that was wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine you friendly; he that was wont to afford a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling face, now diſtaſts you, your ſinnes haue hid his face from you: <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.2. Gods dealings with man are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his owne expreſſion, of his carriage toward <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. <hi>He drawes us with cords of a man, with bands of loue,</hi> deales gently with us, not tyrannically; he is to us, as they that take off the yoke, he is wiſe and pittifull to eaſe us when over-wearied; and hee layes meate unto us, he is plentifull and provident for our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities: theſe are tyes of loue; and God ſo ſpeakes, as if he were not at quiet within himſelfe, as being juſt, yet loth to be ſevere; <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? How ſhall I make thee as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah? Ephraim</hi> hath deſerved <hi>Sodoms</hi> deſtruction, but the Lords repentings are kindled together. What then Shall <hi>Ephraim?</hi> Shall <hi>Iſrael</hi> be ſecure? Nay, if wee are bent to back ſliding from him, <hi>He will haue a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,</hi> as is plainly enough diſcovered in the ſecond verſe of the twelfth Chapter of the ſame <hi>Hoſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Sinne is offenſive unto God, and ſo it becomes an action of treſpaſſe. There are bonds of neighbourhood, and in reſpect of the keeping of theſe, we are ſaid to bee righteous unto one another, and an offence againſt theſe, is called an unrighteouſneſſe, as being a treſpaſſe againſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19096:44"/> the rights of another; now the plea that ariſeth from this, is called an action of treſpaſſe. Sinne is not onely an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, an unrighteouſneſſe, that which offends God. God is holy, ſinne makes us naſtie; God endures not ſuch, but hath his controverſie, his action of treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sinne diſhonours God, that as it were he loſes by it, and therefore hath an action of dammage. The dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is that which the Iurors giue up in their verdict, as an expenſe recoverable. That word which is uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome parts of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, <hi>skath,</hi> ſeemes to come of the <hi>Germane</hi> word, <hi>Schad;</hi> and that of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>schadad,</hi> hee waſted. But thus properly it cannot be ſpoken concerning God, for as our goodnes extends not to him, ſo our ſinne can make no waſt upon him. We cannot make him leſſe excellent, or leſſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; ſo that on the part of God, there cannot be <hi>expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaelitis,</hi> as the Civilians ſpeake; God can be no looſer, yet unto our judgement of things, he complaines that he is diſhonoured, that he is wearied by our ſinnes. <hi>I haue not cauſed thee to ſerue with an offering, nor wearied thee with incenſe; but thou haſt made me to ſerue with thy ſinnes, thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities, Eſay</hi> 43.23.24. In this ſenſe, God is dammaged, and hath his action. I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to the application in two uſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If ſinne be the cauſe of Gods controverſie with a Land, we haue then found the reaſons of Gods ſtroake on ours. We cannot but ſee that God is offended, he hath oft cited us, ſometimes attached us with arreſts, &amp; proceeded againſt us. A little obſervation will tell us, and we need no more knowledge then the <hi>Egyptian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> had to diſcerne and ſay, <hi>This is the finger of God.</hi> And we may fitly uſe that ſpeech of <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 16.46. <hi>There is wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague is begun.</hi> There is much wrath gone out, many plagues: decay of trading in a time of peace: generall poverty in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19096:44"/> all parts of the Land: great houſes empty and decayed: diſtractions at the Holme: abſence from publicke em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: errors in obtruded tenents. I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>button <hi>Marius</hi> before the <hi>Senate</hi> to ſhew more skars; to ſhew which, were in ſtead of oratorie, <hi>Quid opus est verbis ubi vulnera clamant?</hi> wounds ſpeake with a peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Rhetoricke. Onely take notice of the peſtilence, 'tis much abroad, and now come neare to us in theſe more Northern parts. Is God unjuſt? or haue wee not merited what we feele? Nay; wee will cleare him, while we condemne our ſelues: <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of Iacob is all this, and for the ſinnes of the houſe of Iſrael, Mic.</hi> 1.5. Sinne and puniſhment are inſeparable; and to righteouſneſſe and ſinne doth <hi>Salomon</hi> reſolue the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ruine of a people; <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Righteouſneſſe exalteth a Nation, but ſin is a Reproach to any people.</hi> I know that no time hath beene without Complaints, and every age hath ſtill beene thought the worſt, ſo that it hath beene the glory of every one that hath thought himſelfe eloquent and able to ſpeake, to ſpeake againſt the time. I loue not peeviſh and unneceſſary aggravations, for it is eaſie to accuſe and make a <hi>Satyr.</hi> Yet it is not lawfull to cover our ſinnes, neither is it more unlawfull than unprofitable, for <hi>he that covereth his ſinnes ſhall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper;</hi> The rule is no leſſe true of nationall than of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinnes; oh that wee could ſo take notice of ſinnes, as to grieue for them! ſo to diſcover them as to remoue them. Every age hath beene accounted worſt, ours is truely ſo. You will conſent unto it, if you turne over the leaues of Hiſtories, the Records of former times, and compare age with age, ſinnes with ſinnes; What care, what light, what meanes, haue wee ſinned againſt? Our Dunghill hath ſent forth a greater ſtench, a worſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by how much the Sunne hath more and longer ſhone upon it; and we are therefore worſe, becauſe we might haue beene better. It were profitable to ſpend ſometime upon Hiſtory and Compariſon, but I cannot
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19096:45"/> entend that worke, becauſe the method of the Text leades me to another; to the diſcovery of our ſinnes, by thoſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and in that ſame order, firſt of our ſinnes, ſecondly, of the aggravations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our ſinnes of omiſſion, parallel, if not much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed theirs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is no Truth; Terras Aſtraea reliquit,</hi> ſweet Truth together with righteous dealing hath well-nigh forſaken us. Where ſhall we ſeeke for Truth, with hope or incouragement to finde it? Not in the Court, there they tread upon one anothers breaſts to riſe; not in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there they bargaine away their Conſciences; Not in the Country, there the plaine haue learned to deceiue, and more eaſily to deceiue becauſe more plaine; wee cannot finde Truth in fields, in ſhops, nay (which is the heavy miſery of Apoſtatizing times) ſcarce in our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits. Ah! <hi>Beloved,</hi> how unanſwerable are wee to the Goſpell of Truth, to the way of Truth made knowne unto us? Our tongues haue little Truth in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expreſſion, 'tis the onely age of Complement and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall proteſtations, when men ſell words at a cheape price, and thinke it enough to ſpeake well, as if man were made for nothing but a promiſe. There is as little in our hands, why elſe doe we handle the falſe meaſures and ballances of deceit? But the heart is the ſtore-houſe of unfaithfulneſſe, men are of double mindes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder if of double dealings; rather Foxes than men, full of craftineſſe and deceit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is no Mercy.</hi> Mercy which is that ſweet bond of amitie, and faſtens man to man; That which hath the promiſe, <hi>To the mercifull thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe mercifull;</hi> That which our Saviour commended in the Parable as highly pleaſing unto God, Mercy is neglected. There is no mercy in our Cenſures, while we ſit Iudges over every mans actions, and taxe them, yea condemne
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19096:45"/> them without hearing. It is commonly the diſeaſe of weake unbuſied people, who being not furniſhed with abilitie for other employment, nor with conſcience to be much in their owne watch, delight to be doing what is moſt eaſie, to cenſure others. Who ſhall liue free and untainted, if ſuch undiſcerning men haue the chaire, and giue the ſentence? There is no mercy in our Reports, we care not how we wound the reputations and teare the credits of men not offending. There is but little cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, where there is an aptneſſe to entertaine all looſe and ſcandalous reports, and to ſcatter them as buſily, as wee greedily entertaind them. There is no mercy in our dealings, witneſſe the poore neglected, miſerably neglected by you that haue the charge and power in your hands to relieue them, notwithſtanding his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties</hi> late Injunctions, and the extreame neceſſitie; that I name not other kindes of unmercifulneſſe, wherein men ſhew themſelues Tygers and Wolues, rather than men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no knowledge of God in the Land.</hi> It is a knowing time, and men abound in Science; but who knowes God rightly? The prophane know him not, elſe they would not dare to prophane him in his Name, in his Ordinances, in the time of his worſhip. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe know him not, they would elſe extend their bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of mercy. The deceitfull know him not, they would elſe follow Truth. But briefly, our want of obedience argues our want of knowledge of him; and therefore the Apoſtle joynes them, and explicates the one by the other, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>The Lord Ieſus ſhall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our ſinnes of Commiſſion are likewiſe in the parallel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Againſt Truth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is ſwearing.</hi> Men vie oaths with words; and are then moſt wittie, when they can ſweare with the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19096:46"/> beſt invention. The godly mans Character is, that <hi>he feares an Oath, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. But your ordinary uſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, you doe but too much loue them. Foule mouths! that dare with thoſe tongues blaſpheme God, which were given therewith to bleſſe him. Oaths, new, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, high, raſh, ſolemne, againſt Conſcience, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day heaped. May wee not feare the truth of that threat, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Becauſe of ſwearing the Land ſhall mourne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is lying.</hi> Sure the Papiſts learned much do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from <hi>Plato,</hi> and more ſpecially in that, That a lye might be lawfull, to ſaue a Citizen, or deceiue an enemy. Nature eaſily ſubſcribes to this, and allowes of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as a neceſſary vertue for a man of buſineſſe; ſo our dealing is more diſhoneſt than <hi>Machiavels</hi> rule, <hi>That fraud is deteſtable in other actions, but in Warre laudable.</hi> Vnjuſt men count it laudable in every action, and dare diſſemble, not with men onely, but with their owne ſoules, with God; and thinke they never worke wiſely, but when, as it was the brag of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> they walke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly. Diſſemblings are reall lyes; there is another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of them, Merry, officious, hurtfull; Some are patronized by ſome, but by ſtrict rule they are all unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But becauſe I know the diſeaſe of the place where I ſpeake, I will rather touch that, the wittie malicious lye of report. Men are like the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſtill deſirous of new matter, and are wittie onely in inventing. There are a buſie gadding generation, that are the Incendiaries the fire-brands of Pariſhes and neighbour-hoods, what they heare at one houſe, they broach at another with mixture and additions of their owne, to the breach of charitie and that peace, which wee labour to build up, by the Goſpel of peace. This is <hi>the wicked man that walks with a froward mouth, frowardneſſe is in his heart, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth miſchiefe continually, he ſeweth diſcord. Prov.</hi> 6.12.14. But God will contend with ſuch, for he hates them: Of thoſe ſeven things which are an abomination to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19096:46"/> Lord, fiue meet in this man; <hi>A lying tongue, An heart that deviſeth wicked imaginations, Feet that be ſwift in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to miſchiefe, A falſe witneſſe that ſpeaketh lyes, and he that ſoweth diſcord among brethren:</hi> So <hi>Salomon</hi> reckons and diſcovers them: <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.16.17.18.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againſt Mercy:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is killing.</hi> The Land reekes with bloud, many unſeene and unrevenged murthers lye upon us. Bloud hath a voice; <hi>The voice of thy brothers bloud cryeth unto me from the ground, Gen.</hi> 4.10. ſaid God to the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bloud-ſtaind <hi>Cain.</hi> What ſhould I ſpeake of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the heart, unjuſt anger, hatred, envie? Of the outward murthers of the tongue, brawlings, revilings, curſings, ſlanderings? Of the hand, the murther of the body, the murther of the ſoules of others? neither time, nor I thinke the Text would admit of enlargement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a method. It is the ſhedding of bloud is here indited.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is ſtealing.</hi> Thefts are as various as mens bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, and inventions to pervert and abuſe buſineſſe. It were not unfit on a day when we are before the Barre, to arraigne the noted theife, the civill theife, the Church theife; but it were to be wittie rather than ſerious, and the majeſtie of a Sermon admits not of triflings. Onely I would ſuch whom it concernes would in the feare of God take notice, how both odious and dangerous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in our Callings, and oppreſſion, are. <hi>A falſe ballance is an abomination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 11.1. But more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely in the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> Chap. 8.4.5.6.7. <hi>Heare this, O yee that ſwallow up the needy, even to make the poore of the Land to fayle; ſaying, When will the new Moone be gone, that we may ſell Corne? and the Sabbath that we may ſet forth Wheate, making the Ephah ſmall and the Shekel great,</hi> (ſelling a little meaſure for a great price) <hi>and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying the ballances by deceit? That we may buy the poore for ſilver, and the needie for a payre of ſhooes; yea and ſell the refuſe of the Wheat.</hi> But heare and tremble at the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19096:47"/> doome; <hi>The Lord hath ſworne by the excellencie of Iacob, ſurely I will never forget any of their workes: ſhall not the Land tremble for this?</hi> Let oppreſſors be warned, that are wont to grind the faces of the poore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is committing Adultery.</hi> The breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie is by many wayes: uncleanneſſe is that filthy, yet generall ſinne that makes the Land yeeld a ſtench into the noſthrills of God, multitudes of families being pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with a baſtard brood. It would offend you, to be led with <hi>Ezekiel into the Chambers;</hi> and it cannot but be irkſome to know, that in a Land where the pure Goſpel is taught, there ſhould be ſtewes, like the cloſe Cells of <hi>Tyberius</hi> in his filthy obſcure <hi>Capraea.</hi> Tis a ſinne too much neglected, by them that haue power to puniſh it, but however, ſuch ſhall not goe unpenanced; for God hath threatned, <hi>Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will judge. Iſrael joyned himſelfe unto Baal-peor, and the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael. Num.</hi> 25.3. <hi>Baal-peor</hi> is thought by <hi>Origen, Ierom, Iſidore,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be that uncleane <hi>Priapus,</hi> and called by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines <hi>Idolum Tentiginis:</hi> I rather conſent to that opinion, (beſides the whole Story which is plaine to proue it,) becauſe of that word in the verſe, <hi>Iſrael joyned himſelfe:</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">

But as it was ſpoken in another caſe, Ah! <hi>Let Baal plead for himſelfe.</hi> To defend unchaſtitie in the leaſt meaſure, were to be a Baud to proſtitutes. They are looſe, ungovernd, wanton times; wee may feare God may ſend a ſweeping deſtruction, to make cleane a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, naſtie, foul-ſpotted people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus wee ſee in them the parallel of our ſinnes; ſecondly, let us now take notice of their, of our aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our boldneſſe in ſinning. <hi>Wee breake out,</hi> no bonds, no Law, no diſcipline reſtraines us: But as we haue ſeene a mightie furious Torrent, when the proud waues grow ſtrong with the addition of new waters, it ſwells over the bankes, makes breaches, and ruſhes over what ever lyes to hinder the courſe; So, and much more are wee mad after ſinne, and neglect all Law made to oppoſe or curb our violence. I thinke that it is the <hi>Metaphor,</hi> the Prophet here uſeth, <hi>They breake out. Iob</hi> hath another, and a fit one, of the <hi>Horſe prepared to the Battell, it cares not for the noyſe of the Trumpets, for the clattering of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and armour, for the confuſed Cryes of men wounded, but ventures on without feare;</hi> So the bold ſinner ruſhes upon evill, and cares onely to ſinne, without feare of an after-reckoning. Men are not now baſhfull to offend, but though wicked workes are called <hi>workes of darkenes,</hi> they are committed in the day, in the ſight of the Sunne. It aggravated the fault of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> that he lay with his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19096:48"/> Fathers Concubines before all the people; That <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi</hi> worſhipped <hi>Peor</hi> before the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſight of all the Congregation. Heretofore men blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed when they ſinned; I haue heard men ſay, that the extortions of griping Officers were called <hi>Gratuities</hi> for expedition, but now thoſe Wormes dare ſpeake loud the language of <hi>Elyes</hi> ſonnes: If any ſay, <hi>Faile not to burne the fat preſently, and then take as much as thy ſoule deſireth:</hi> They are readie to anſwere, <hi>Nay but thou ſhalt giue it me now, and if not I will take it by force.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.16. The Apoſtle intimates, that ſhame attends ſinne, <hi>What fruit had yee then of thoſe things whereof yee are now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Rom.</hi> 6.21. But where is that ingenuitie which <hi>Paul</hi> found among the <hi>Romans?</hi> Where that modeſtie? Men are not aſhamed of whoring, drinking, ſwearing, envying; but as the Apoſtle in ſomewhat another ſenſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Now the workes of the fleſh are manifeſt.</hi> Men ſinne with courage, with confidence, with violence; <hi>They breake out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our multitude of ſinnes, <hi>Bloud toucheth bloud,</hi> a generall profaneneſſe hath ſpread it ſelfe. The ſinnes of former times were but as drops, or as ſmall gliding brookes; ours as Torrents, broad deepe Chanells by the confluence of many waters. Some men that are not old, remember, when Drunkards were as Owles gazed on and hooted at by boyes, now every Alehouſe hath a full croud, and (which I would the Magiſtrates that are preſent would take notice of) the Benches there are thronged, when ſometimes the ſeates here are more emptie. Oaths were more rare, now they are vied with words, in a neglectiue manner men uſe them and forget that they uſe them. It were not an eaſie matter to name thoſe many ſinnes that with eaſe are committed: waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, pride, wantonneſſe, worldlineſſe, contempt of the Word, ſlighting the Ordinances, and other the like, are beyond Arithmeticke. I cannot marſhall them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their rankes, becauſe of the throng; <hi>Bloud toucheth bloud.</hi>

It were not ſo much for enemies, for ſtrangers to offend; but as we are, to offend, is not onely to diſpleaſe, but to reproach our God. Tis the relation, that makes the diſhonour redound to him. <hi>A fooliſh ſonne diſhonoureth his father, and is a ſhame to his mother:</hi> and therefore a ſhame, becauſe a ſonne. We all haue indignation at it, that we heare of ſome about us that liue diſordered, but it doth not more particularly touch us then others; but if the ſonne of any of us, ſhould lead the diſorder, this would touch with diſcredit, as well as indignation. It is our profeſſion, our religion, which we are unanſwerable unto, that diſhonours God and aggravates our ſinne. Here is the ſtrength of the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, and motiue to repent; The name of <hi>Solomon</hi> is named upon the <hi>Shulamite;</hi> and therefore, <hi>Returne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne O Shulamite, returne, returne.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19096:49"/> not poſſible for us to reſiſt God, he hath many wayes to plead his owne cauſe; to accompliſh his fury, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeakes and uſeth that phraſe. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.12. <hi>He that is farre off ſhall die of the pestilence, and hee that is neere ſhall fall by the ſword; and he that remaines and is beſieged ſhall die by the famine; thus will I accompliſh my fury upon them.</hi> To prevent ſuch fury, men haue uſually recourſe unto their ſeveral ſtrengths, for all men frame unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſome ſtrength where they may refuge themſelues from danger. The Idolaters ſtrength is his Idol, but that cannot deliver from God; and therefore it followes in the thirteenth verſe; <hi>Then ſhall ye know that I am the Lord, when their ſlaine men ſhall be among their Idols round about their altars,</hi> the place where they did offer ſweete ſavour to all their Idols. We cannot prevaile by ſtanding out; as God hath his action againſt us, ſo his proceſſes to fetch us in. There is a <hi>capias,</hi> or <hi>exigi facias,</hi> in cauſes of treaſon or felony, and God pleaſes to keepe a legall courſe in his writs; he begins with a <hi>venire facias,</hi> if we anſwer not, he ſends a <hi>capias pluries;</hi> but (not to triflle or play with the <hi>metaphor</hi>) I meane, we cannot be out of Gods reach. And when we appeare, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, for he is Iudge of the cauſe, and the Court is his; and ſhall wee contend with the Iudge in his owne Court? Wee are ſure to be caſt: yet he is not unjuſt to make a partiall deciſion; but we are therefore ſure to be caſt out, becauſe he is juſt. How then? or what courſe ſhall we take? Wee muſt firſt worke on his will (which I would haue entertained in the ſenſe I meane it, and ſhall explaine it,) and after upon his power. Wee cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Lord, unleſſe the Lord bee pleaſed to ſhew which way he may be overcome: ſo <hi>Samſon</hi> dealt with <hi>Dalilah;</hi> (if it be not preſumption to compare this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſuch a type,) <hi>Samſon</hi> was ſtrong beyond the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> power, till at length himſelfe told where his ſtrength lay, and how the otherwiſe weake might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. God hath revealed the way to make vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19096:49"/> wee muſt meet him by humiliation and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This is our wiſedome to be ſubmiſſe; By ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, God winnes of us, and wee of God; God quarrells but for his glory; he ſtrikes us to make us humble, that wee acknowledge him our Soveraigne; when wee are ſubmiſſe, God hath tamed us, and wee giue God challenges, his honour in our ſubjection and obedience.</p>
               <p>That which we ſtriue for, is our ſafetie, ſubmiſſion prevailes for that, for God leaues to ſtrike when wee leaue to be ſtubborne: By this meanes, both are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and both Triumph.

It was a good policie in that ſervant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.27.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F man haue a Controverſie with us, it is becauſe God hath one; yet this is the Chriſtians advantage, to haue recourſe to God though at controverſie, to haue reliefe againſt anothers ſuite. The Text is in the eighth Section of the <hi>Hebrew Doctors Lectures,</hi> beginning at the third Verſe of this, and continues to the end of the thirtie-ſixth Chapter. This part of the <hi>Paraſhu</hi> is the Story of what befell <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in his way, the relation of two dangers, <hi>His feare of Eſau, His wreſtling with the Angel.</hi> While wee liue, wee are upon our journey, and while upon our journey wee are in the warre, and haue <hi>Catenata certamina,</hi> new on-ſets, frequent Encounters. <hi>Iacob</hi> had hot Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, he feares <hi>Eſau,</hi> and thinkes himſelfe forſaken, he wreſtles with an Angel, and apprehends God as an enemy, yet he continues in the field &amp; prevailes in both. Ile not touch upon the Story, to leade you on to what I haue choſen, and meane to dwell upon; The firſt part of the Story, is <hi>Iacobs</hi> going home-ward; wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His meeting of the Angels, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Iacob</hi> went on his way, and the Angels of God met him; There were an Hoſt of men with <hi>Eſau,</hi> and here an Army of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19096:51"/> Angels with <hi>Iacob;</hi> God every where affords defence unto his owne: <hi>O taſt and ſee that the Lord is good. The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him, and delivereth them. Pſal.</hi> 34.7.8. Gods Hoſt is a ſure guard, <hi>Iacob</hi> called it <hi>Machanaim,</hi> The place of two Armyes; there is ſafetie upon either hand, defence upon both ſides, for them that truſt in God. As God divided the red Sea, ſo he doth his Army; The waters were a wall upon the right hand, and a wall upon the left; ſo, becauſe dangers are on every hand, on the right hand from proſperitie, on the left from trouble, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every place is <hi>Machanaim</hi> to the godly, a place of two Campes. Mercy proportioned unto danger, a compaſſing mercy, <hi>He compaſſeth with mercy as with a Sheild.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His Embaſſie to his brother <hi>Eſau; verſ.</hi> 3.4.5. Whether is he more wiſe or humble? He was to paſſe through his brothers Country, and feares leſt perhaps as yet he was not reconciled, and therefore makes tryall and prepares his way by a meſſage; 'Tis a meſſage of great and imitable modeſtie. Let us deale ſo towards one another, chiefly with our offended God, ſend to him and propitiate him with ſuch a preſent as may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His feare at the returne of his meſſengers, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.7. His ſervants tell, they had no anſwere to returne, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe what they obſerved were a returne of anſwere; Wee onely ſaw great alteration upon our meſſage, they make preparation of great Forces, <hi>Eſau</hi> comes forth to meet thee with foure hundred men. They ſpake much in ſuch an anſwere; And <hi>Iacob</hi> feared greatly. <hi>Iacob</hi> had newly eſcaped <hi>Laban,</hi> and now he feares to fall into the hands of <hi>Eſau;</hi> What inconſtancie is there in humane condition? What varietie of Changes? <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ices rerum inſtabiles.</hi> Yet that he feared greatly, was his infirmitie. The Saints haue many infirmities, there were two great ſinnes, in this one carriage, too much ſuſpition, and too
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19096:52"/> much feare. It was his ſinne to be ſo ſuſpitious, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of a brother; He comes forth with foure hundred men; might not the great preparation be entended as well for <hi>Iacobs</hi> honour as deſtruction? What did <hi>Iacob</hi> know, but his brother meant to grace him with a large entertainment? Charitie is favourable in its interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of other mens dealings. Yet if he had cauſe of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, what cauſe had he of ſo much feare? <hi>Eſau</hi> comes with foure hundred men; But what are foure hundred men, to two hoſts of Angels? His power was greater than the adverſe power, if he could ſee it and make uſe of it. Had he alreadie forgotten <hi>Machanaim?</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderateneſſe of our feare and diſtruſt ariſeth from this, that wee ſee not God neare and able, <hi>a preſent helpe in the time of need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The meanes he uſeth for his defence; they are two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The diviſion of his family; <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.8. A good and commendable policie; onely here is ſome ſcruple, he ſeemes to haue forgot or neglected the right method, he firſt divides his family and then prayes, who ſhould firſt haue prayed and then divided his family. 'Tis true. God firſt is to be ſought, that Heathen ſaw it from whom wee had the rule, <hi>A Iove principium;</hi> yet ſome ſudden buſineſſes ſometimes admitting not delay, though they cannot deferre our ejaculatory, they may our ſolemne prayers. Thus <hi>Iacob</hi> neglected not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remedie, which was,</p>
               <p n="2">2. His prayer, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.10.11.12. Where wee may obſerue for the preſent, to the purpoſe that I entend; <list>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he prayes. <hi>Iacobs</hi> feare puts him upon any courſe for ſafetie, but his Religion directs him to a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe; his wiſedome to the beſt, <hi>And Iacob ſaid, O God of my Fathers, Deliver mee I pray thee.</hi> I could not eaſily take my ſelfe off, from the ſweer meditation
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19096:52"/> on the former paſſages; but there I meant but to gleane as I paſſed; but the feild where our worke lyes, where the harveſt is, Is this Concluſion;
<q>That prayer is the remedie of our Diſtreſſes.</q>

               <p>

               <p n="1">1. What Prayer is; I confeſſe it is a taske not ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afforded from this, as ſome other Texts; yet without much tranſgreſſion of art, wee may inlarge our ſelues upon the diſcovery of the nature of prayer, ſpecially on a day of prayer. The internall eſſentiall common nature of prayer, is, that it is a religious motion unto God; It is religious becauſe <hi>ex charitate,</hi> for Religion it ſelfe is <hi>ex charitate,</hi> as in that the Schoole hath well expreſt; and that it is a motion, is concluded; ſome ſay of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Aſcenſus intellectus;</hi> ſome ſay of the minde, <hi>Mentis aſcenſus:</hi> what needs that difference; It is the ſoules motion, the motion of the will. But that is not full enough; I like that deſcription of our Countriman in his <hi>Medulla;</hi> Prayer is the religious motion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of our will before God, that God may as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> were be affected with it. So hearing and praying differ, in hearing, our wills are moved; in praying, as it were Gods; but that wee ſhall cleare here-after. For the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication of the preſent, I ſhall onely make uſe of ſome recollected thoughts, which I affoorded to my owne Congregation, the afternoone of the laſt Sabbath in the ordinary way of my Catechizing, to ſpeake of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19096:53"/> Eſſentialls to prayer, which are principally theſe fiue.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That wee muſt pray unto God alone.</item>
                  <item>2. That we muſt pray in the name of Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>3. That we muſt pray by the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</item>
                  <item>4. That we muſt pray in a right manner.</item>
                  <item>5. That we muſt pray for things lawfull.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is eſſentiall unto prayer, that wee pray unto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi> Prayer is, <hi>In auxilium vocare;</hi> when wee pray, we ſeeke for helpe without our ſelues; now God onely ſuites unto that. He that wee pray unto, muſt be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely knowing, to ſee all that ſpread abroad their hands, to heare all ſupplications; and infinitely powerfull, to helpe all that need and call. In regard of the one, God hath a name from it, God that heareth prayers; <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, to thee ſhall all fleſh come. Pſal.</hi> 65.2. In regard of the other, God challengeth our prayer, <hi>Call upon mee in the day of trouble, and I will deliver. Pſal.</hi> 50.16. It was nature which taught this to the heathen Mariners, <hi>They prayd every man to his god, and call unto Ionah that he ſhould cry unto his God. Ion.</hi> 1.5.6. But this need not ſtay me for it is granted on all hands, but where Covetouſneſſe hath invented a doctrine of gaine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wee muſt pray in the name of Chriſt;</hi> it is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, elſe wee pray but as Creatures, not as Chriſtians: The creature (as a creature) hath recourſe to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of being for the <hi>Bene eſſe,</hi> and continuance of be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing; But the Chriſtian hath his approach in Chriſt, <hi>In whom wee haue boldneſſe and acceſſe with confidence by the faith of him. Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. This is our confidence in our acceſſe, for the promiſe is to this; <hi>Whatſoever yee ſhall aske the Father in my Name, he will giue it you, hitherto yee haue asked nothing in my Name, aske and yee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. Ioh.</hi> 16.23.24. Some thinke, <hi>Daniel</hi> who ſaw the myſtery though the Clouds, made uſe of it, in that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19096:53"/> forme, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17. <hi>O our God, heare the prayer of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for the Lords ſake.</hi> Wee all know it, and with ſuch formes are wont to conclude our prayers, but wee are not reall in it to minde it truely in all our petitions. The Law is in <hi>Leviticus, That if a man kill an Oxe, or a Lambe, or a Goate, and bring it not unto the dore of the Tabernacle to the Prieſt, bloud ſhall be imputed unto that man.</hi> Though the offering be good in it ſelfe, an Oxe, or a Lambe, yet if it be not brought unto the Prieſt to offer, God is ſo farre from accepting it, that he accounts it a murther ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a ſacrifice. When in our prayers wee expreſſe our ſelues ſorrowfull for our ſinnes, truely humbled in the ſenſe of them, earneſt and importunate for pardon and cure; Theſe are good, but not enough; if we come not in the name of Chriſt, all the reſt is to offer without the Prieſt, and then neither wee nor it are accepted; for Prayer is Gods Ordinance unto us as we ſtand in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and we can onely come unto him as in the Covenant. How then without Chriſt? But in his name confidently; Lord, here I bring my ſacrifice, I am unworthy to offer it, accept it onely from the hands of the Prieſt, in the name of my Chriſt, in whom I am bold to draw neare and offer. This onely preſents us with acceptation; It is not the excellency, or the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, or the holineſſe of our prayers, (if theſe could be imagined poſſibly to ſtand without Chriſt,) but Chriſt that makes them accepted. So is the Law in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of the ſame Booke, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. from the ſixth verſe to the thirteenth, <hi>That if a man bring a Lambe, a Kid of the Goats, the Prieſt muſt offer it;</hi> or if <hi>not able to bring a Lambe, he bring two turtle Doues or two young Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, the Prieſt muſt offer them;</hi> or if <hi>not able to bring two turtle Doues, if he bring the tenth part of an Epha of fine flower, the Prieſt ſhall offer it, and it ſhall be an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The Lambe is a richer offering, yet it is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without the Prieſt; But with the Prieſt, a poore ſmall offering, a ſmall meaſure of flower, the tenth part
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19096:54"/> of an <hi>Ephath,</hi> is an attonement. Conceiue all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of a prayer, the compoſure of words, the waight of matter, the heate of delivery; all are deſpiſed things without Chriſt; but in him, our eſſayes and offers, our un-artfull and untaught ſtammerings and groanes are pleaſing. When the Sacrifice is layd downe, <hi>Aaron</hi> muſt caſt the Incenſe upon the fire, that the Cloud of the Incenſe may cover the Mercy-ſeate. <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.12.13. When wee pray, ſo much imperfection accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes our prayer, that the fume may be offenſiue unto Gods noſthrills, but Chriſt caſts in the Incenſe, his Interceſſion makes what wee offer, ſweet. This is our priviledge which wee muſt make uſe of, <hi>We haue an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father; for there is one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Wee muſt pray by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit;</hi> God promiſeth that aſſiſtance; <hi>I will powre upon the houſe of David the ſpirit of ſupplications; Zach.</hi> 12.10. Neither can we pray, nor will God heare without him. <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit helpeth our infirmities, for wee know not what wee ſhould pray for as wee ought, but the ſpirit it ſelfe maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us with gronings which cannot be uttered, and he that ſearcheth the hearts knoweth what the minde of the ſpirit is, becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God. Rom.</hi> 8.26.27. God knowes the minde of the Spirit, he takes notice of that; for a ſpirituall prayer is his owne worke, the voice of God; but a prayer from our own ſpirit is the voice of fleſh, and that God heares not. Nature may pray, the fleſh may cry to God for what it needs to the ſuſtaining of it ſelfe; But God termes this rather howling than prayer. <hi>They aſſembled themſelues for Corne and Wine; and they haue not cryed unto mee with their heart, when they howled upon their beds. Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. All theſe three, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath couched and taught in one ſentence, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Through Him wee haue both an acceſſe by one Spirit unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:19096:54"/>4. <hi>We muſt pray in a right manner.</hi> The Spirit teacheth this, for <hi>he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God. Rom.</hi> 8.17. Which is the command, and to which the promiſe is, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.14. <hi>This is the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that wee haue in him, that if wee aske any thing aecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will he heareth vs.</hi> The generall rule in the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1.2. is moſt appliable to this; <hi>Keepe thy foote when thou goeſt to the houſe of God; bee not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſtie to utter any thing before God, for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let thy words be few.</hi> And that the heart may not bee haſtie, we muſt fixe it by preparation, that we may ſay as <hi>David, O God wy heart is fixed, Pſal.</hi> 108.1. But I'le tell you of the right manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Generally. In generall, the perſon muſt bee right, for then there is acceptance; according to the Pſalmiſts manner of arguing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>But know that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelfe: the Lord will heare when I call unto him.</hi> We haue audience by vertue of the Covenant, and therefore haue particular grants becauſe we haue Chriſt, that is to be in generall in the Covenant, and ſuch a one the Scriptures call a <hi>righteous man:</hi> this man prevailes, <hi>The prayer</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man,</hi> prevaileth; (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>prevaileth much, Iam.</hi> 5.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. More particularly, there muſt be to the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>attentio mentis,</hi> and <hi>intentio voluntatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The attention of the mind, the mind of him that prayes muſt attend.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Vnto God, unto whom the prayer is directed: we muſt ſee ſupply in God, and enough ſupply; we muſt ſee goodneſſe, wiſedome, power in God, and ſolely in God; that he is, and onely <hi>is good unto them that call upon;</hi> wiſe to ſet the beſt wayes for our good, able to remoue all diſadvantages that might hinder our good; and ſo of his other attributes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt attend unto the worke; to pray.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:19096:55"/>1. With underſtanding; of which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught the neceſſitie. <hi>If I pray in an unknowne tongue, my ſpirit prayeth,</hi> (I exerciſe my gift) <hi>but my underſtanding is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull;</hi> (they that joyne with me are not bettered by my gift: <hi>What is it then? I will pray with the ſpirit, and I will pray with underſtanding alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts doe but count their beades, they doe not pray; and the ignorant are like the Papiſts, they doe but ſay the words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With faith: this honors God and makes us bold, for <hi>in Chriſt we haue boldneſſe and acceſſe with confidence by the faith of him; Ephe.</hi> 3.12. <hi>And how ſhall they call on him, in whom they haue not beleeved? Rom.</hi> 10.14. The rule is in <hi>Iames; If any man lacke wiſedome, let him aske of God, and it ſhall be given him; but let him aske in faith nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a waue of the ſea driven with the wind and toſſed, let not that man thinke he ſhall receiue any thing of the Lord. Iam.</hi> 1.5.6.7. Faith ballaſts the ſoule, without it the ſoule floats; ſometimes it thinkes it hath a promiſe, and then it riſeth to a vaine height, the height of preſumption; ſometimes it is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven off, and then it ſinkes. <hi>Moſes</hi> his hands were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times up, and ſometimes they fell downe, till a ſtone was put under them, then continued praying, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaild againſt <hi>Amalek. Exod.</hi> 17.12. The heart muſt be eſtabliſhed upon ſomething; we muſt haue faith in the providence, and faith in the promiſes: and then the heart growes quiet, as tis ſaid of <hi>Hannah; Shee ſpake in her heart;</hi> it was not a formall lip-prayer, <hi>and her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was no more ſad.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13.18. When ſhee had poured forth her ſoule before the Lord, ſhee was quiet, ſhee then reſted. Deſire, and hope, and feare, are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extremes and are full of paine; but faith attends with eaſe and knowes aſſuredly, that enough, that is, ſo much of the promiſe as is fit ſhall be performed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt attend unto our ſelues, that wee bee not diſtracted in prayer. To that queſtion, whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19096:55"/> of this attention doe fruſtrate prayer? The <hi>Schoole-men</hi> haue anſwered, <hi>That not an actuall, but a virtuall attention is ever neceſſary.</hi> I cannot altogether reject that anſwere, for though an actuall attention in every prayer, and in every part of prayer is very commendable, and that which wee muſt indeavour for, yet the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall attention which is to perſiſt in the diſpoſition to attend, is that which is neceſſary. I ſhall cleare this by diſtinguiſhing of our wandrings. The ſoule is apt to gad, and thoſe wandrings from the duetie which are by our owne neglect, theſe make our prayer to be ſinne. If otherwiſe they are not ours, but Sathans injections, they fruſtrate not our prayer, though they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hinder our comfort. It is the Archers fault if he hit not the marke, if himſelfe were careleſſe of his poſture, of his ayme: but if he ayme rightly, and intend his ſhaft to the marke, and another purpoſely jogge his arme in the delivery of the Arrow, tis the fault of the other, not his. Here is our tryall; doe wee intend the marke, to ſend the ſhaft of prayer to heaven rightly? then the malice of the ſtander-by ſhall not hinder our entrance and audience. But however, becauſe of our weakeneſſe, and the Devils maliciouſneſſe, wee muſt be the more upon our watch; and like the wiſe-man of whom <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeakes, wee muſt <hi>haue our hearts in our hands:</hi> that is, alwayes in a readineſſe for every holy dutie that wee ſet about. The heart muſt accompany prayer, and therefore wee muſt attend, that it be within our reach; for it is apt to ſtray, and then wee are dull and without life in prayer. Wee muſt keepe our hearts in tune, that when wee ſtrike upon the ſtrings of that inſtrument, there may be melodie to God, who may delight to heare. This is the attention of the minde.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be the intention of the Will; and this is the Exhibition or repreſentation of the Will before God: which I ſhall beſt ſhew you what it is, by two phraſes of Scripture which deſcribe prayer, <hi>A powring
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19096:56"/> out,</hi> and <hi>a lifting up of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A powring out of the ſoule. The phraſe is uſed by <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 1.15. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. <hi>Powre out your heart before him.</hi> It uſually ſignifies to deale freely with any one; yet without ſtraining, there are two things in the phraſe, Reverence and Humilitie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wee muſt pray with reverence, which is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that Religion it ſelfe is deſcribed to be, <hi>Actus Reverentiae.</hi> When wee pray wee come before God, and when wee come before God, wee ſtand upon holy ground, and in that caſe the command was unto <hi>Moſes</hi> that he ſhould <hi>plucke off his ſhooes.</hi> We muſt be of a ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing geſture, our poſture and carriage before God muſt witneſſe our reverence, that wee tremble at the glory of his preſence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee muſt pray with humilitie; wee haue a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne in <hi>Abraham,</hi> his very formes are imitable, <hi>I haue taken upon mee to ſpeake unto the Lord which am but duſt and aſhes; Oh let not my Lord be angry and I will ſpeake; Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will ſpeake but this once. Gen.</hi> 18.27.30.32. He attends every petition with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie. So our <hi>Iacob</hi> whoſe ſtory wee are now upon; <hi>I am not worthy the leaſt of all thy mercies.</hi> And that poore dejected <hi>Publican</hi> giues us an example of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humilitie; he comes unto the Temple, for his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought him thither, and he dares not neglect a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie though he be not worthy to performe it; but when he is come there, how doth he behaue himſelfe? how humbly? how ſadly? <hi>He ſtands afarre off;</hi> as not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to preſſe nearer to a glorious preſence: <hi>he weuld not lift up ſo much as his eyes towards heaven,</hi> as aſhamed to behold that againſt which he had ſinned: <hi>he ſmites upon his breaſt,</hi> with remorce and feare and indignation; and all that he can bring out at laſt is no more but this, <hi>God be mercifull to mee a ſinner. Luk.</hi> 18.13. And this is the acceptable prayer, though he durſt ſcarce ſpeake, God readily heard him, <hi>he went away juſtified:</hi> ſo that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19096:56"/> wee may ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Lord thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble.</hi> There are two Originall words that doe liuely expreſſe this unto us; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in Greeke ſignifies to pray, is of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the knee: and the Hebrew word <hi>Berecha</hi> prayer, is of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Berech, Ingeniculando fudit preces:</hi> both importing, the bowing of the knee in prayer. Humilitie is ſo neceſſary that the promiſe is to it; 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7.14. <hi>If my people ſhall humble themſelues and pray, then I will heare from heaven.</hi> And, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>To this man will I looke, even to him that is poore and of a contrite ſpirit.</hi> This is the Sacrifice that God accepts, when ſacrifices and burnt-offrings will not pleaſe him. This is the <hi>powring forth of the ſoule:</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other phraſe is;</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A lifting up of the ſpirit;</hi> the phraſe is uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Vnto thee O Lord doe I lift up my ſoule.</hi> And it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies alſo two things, fervency and continuance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Fervency. Wee muſt haue zeale and heate in our prayers; <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The effectuall fervent prayer avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth much.</hi> Zeale puts the heart into a good temper and apts it for motion, which cannot be without an heate: beſides it helpes on prayer, and makes it ſpeedie. Prayer is the weapon with which wee fight, zeale giues that an edge, for wee are eaſily dulled and need that whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And to uſe another expreſſion; prayer aſcends as the fire: the fire moues unto its owne place, to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire in the hollow of the Moone, and that it may paſſe the better without hindrance, it goes up like a <hi>py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis</hi> ſpirewiſe, ſharpe-poynted, the more eaſily to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate: zeale is the pyramidall or poynted flame of prayer, and wings it up freely till it come before God, and peirces with a kinde of violence till it gaine an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. Tis a fit Story which St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> hath, Ile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate it to you; When he came as a viſitant to the houſe of a ſicke man, he ſaw the roome full of friends and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who were all ſilent, yet all weeping, the wife ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, the children crying out, the kinsfolks lamenting;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19096:57"/> The good Father ſuddenly utters a prayer; <hi>Domine, quas preces exaudis, ſi has non exaudis?</hi> Lord, what pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doſt thou heare if thou heareſt not theſe? A prayer not ſo much artfull, as vehement, hath a kinde of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in it. And the Scripture ſets it forth by ſuch like words; <hi>To cry, To wreſtle, To ſtriue,</hi> all arguing an holy importunitie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Continuance. True zeale continues, tis a fire, not a flame onely; and according to the Apoſtles Rule; <hi>Wee muſt pray alwayes.</hi> 1. In the conſtant diſpoſition of heart. 2. In act at all ſeaſonable opportunities, all fit times, as is interpreted by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the very choice of the Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So wee reade that <hi>Mephiboſheth eate continually at the Kings ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.13. And that <hi>Anna departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God day and night; Luk.</hi> 2.37. that is, when ever the time was ſeaſonable and opportune. We muſt continue to pray, though wee finde our ſelues indiſpoſed to prayer, and therefore wee muſt continue becauſe indiſpoſed. The Devill ſometimes teaches our ſloath to object, That wee are dull and dead and unapt, and were therefore better not pray at all, then pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life. But it is with our ſoules, as ſometimes with ſome part of our bodyes; If a man leane long upon his Arme without motion of it, it becomes ſo benummed that tis made unfit for motion, but wee continue rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of that part, till wee bring the bloud to the ſame free courſe againe: Such dulneſſe and diſtemper by our owne neglect oft grows upon our better part, but wee muſt be conſtant in the warming and rubbing of the ſoule; when wee are dull, to pray againſt dulneſſe; and not to leaue the worke, till wee finde our former life running freely, and ſpirit in our veines.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt particular that I propounded for explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eſſentialls to prayer, is, That wee muſt pray for things lawfull. The promiſe is, that <hi>Good things ſhall be given to them that aske them; Mat.</hi> 7.11. The higheſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19096:57"/> good is Gods glory, then our good and the Churches. Our good is ſpirituall and temporall. Spiritualls are ſo farre to be asked as they are promiſed, ſo farre as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation; That wee ſhould haue grace is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, and therefore wee pray abſolutely for it: Degrees and meaſures are not limitedly neceſſary, therefore for limited and ſet meaſures wee may not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely pray; yet for neceſſary meaſures abſolutely, becauſe abſolutely neceſſary. Temporalls may be prayed for, and with determination of what wee petition, for <hi>Licet orare, quod licet deſiderare.</hi> Some haue thought wee may not pray for Temporalls but onely in the generall and conditionally. I thinke they too much ſtreighten us; for a conditionall petition doth petition nothing, nor doth a generall: If a ſicke man pray in ſuch a forme, Lord ſend me what thou knoweſt fit for me; I diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not the forme, yet the ſicke-man prayes not more for his health then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of his diſeaſe. I thinke it lawfull, and not onely lawfull, but fit, that he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and particulariſe his prayer, Lord ſend health; yet ſtill in this ſenſe it is conditionall, though we determine the petition, yet ever to uſe an expreſſe or tacite ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods will, and wiſedome. Theſe are the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls to prayer, in my Catecheticall Method the other day to my owne, I followed likewiſe the Accidentalls to prayer, and more largely, but here meant onely to make uſe of what is neceſſary to our preſent purpoſe; and haue ſufficiently ſhewed what prayer is, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part to be explicated I ſhall be briefer, which is; 2. How it yeelds remedy. When wee pray and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon this or that particular thing, wee doe as it were apply Gods will unto it, and when that applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, wee are ſaid to prevaile. Now wee cannot apply Gods will by commanding of it, that were blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to imagine, nor by a familiar poſtulation, that were not leſſe then blaſphemy, but by a ſubmiſſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of our will unto him. Therefore ſome haue
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19096:58"/> expreſſed themſelues thus; When wee pray unto men wee mooue and affect them with what wee ſay, but when unto God, our ſelues are rather mooved and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the change is in us, wee are fitted for a grant. But I thinke wee may admit of more, That God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors this ordinance as declaring himſelfe affected by it, becauſe it is that <hi>medium</hi> onely by which being interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient or interceding God imparts much unto us. Not that God is any way ignorant and needs this repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our wills, for <hi>he underſtands our thoughts a-farre off; Pſal.</hi> 139.2. Nor that God of nilling is bowed and made willing by theſe repreſentations, for <hi>with him is no variableneſſe, neither ſhadow of turning; Iam.</hi> 1.17. But onely that it is his way, that ordinance which himſelfe hath appointed, and wee onely impetrate what wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him to will. So that our prayers doe argue no change in God, neither doth the firmeneſſe of eternall providence hinder our prayers, but wee onely uſe Gods way, and entreat what wee beleeue him to will, as it is cleare in that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>This is the confidence that wee haue in him, that if wee aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> And more cleare in an example, that of <hi>Davids</hi> prayer for the eſtabliſhing of his houſe; <hi>Let the houſe of David thy ſervant be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before thee, for thou haſt told thy ſervant thou wilt build him an houſe, therefore thy ſervant hath found in his heart to pray before thee, and now O Lord, thou art God and haſt promiſed this goodneſſe, now therefore let it pleaſe thee to bleſſe the houſe of thy ſervant.</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.25.26.27. I haue done with the explication; It follows,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Confirmation of the truth. The very explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is proofe enough, prayer is our remedy in diſtreſſes, for our remedy lyes in God, and prayer mooues to him. It is not our ſtrength that prevailes, but the Covenant; and when wee are in that wee ſucceede; <hi>The effectuall fervent prayer of a righteous man prevaileth much. Elias was a man ſubject to like paſſions as wee are, and he prayed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19096:58"/> earneſtly that it might not raine, and it rained not for the ſpace of three yeares and ſixe moneths. Iam.</hi> 5.15.16. It was not <hi>Elias</hi> that prevailed, he was ſubject to the ſame infirmities with us, but <hi>Elias</hi> rightly made uſe of the ordinance and prevailed in that he ſought. I might inſtance unto you the many examples of Scripture, what glorious things are ſayd of prayer, and how often it hath wonne the victory; but I will onely preſent two unto your memory; That of <hi>Peters</hi> deliverance, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. Which in the fifth <hi>verſe</hi> is reſolved into this; <hi>Peter was kept in priſon, but prayer was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing of the Church unto God for him.</hi> The Church would not ſuffer <hi>Peter</hi> to remaine impriſoned, but with prayer they burſt open the priſon-gates, with prayer they file off his loade of irons. The other is this of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> in the 28. <hi>verſe</hi> of this Chapter, he hath a triumph after the Conqueſt; He that wreſtled with <hi>Iacob</hi> ſayd unto him, <hi>Thy name ſhall be called no more Iacob, but Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, for as a Prince haſt thou power with God and haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</hi> Becauſe of this power, they that pray are ſayd to Helpe together, <hi>God delivered us and will deliver you alſo. Helping together by prayer for us.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. Therefore the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> the mightie Apoſtle, yet when he was for journey to a <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> entreats the aſſiſtance and ſafe-conduct and Guard of Supplicants; <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren, that yee ſtriue together with mee in your prayers to God for mee, that I may be delivered from them that beleeue not in Iudaea. Rom.</hi> 15.30. The word <gap reason="foreign">

Ile adde no more for confirmation, nor need I to thoſe that haue but tryed it; but deſcend briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19096:59"/> to application in a threefold Vſe, to inſtruct, reproue, exhort.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If prayer doe remedie our diſtreſſes, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs in a double truth: 1. In the reaſon why the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray ſo much, ſo frequent: The blind throng won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the uſuall and often aſſemblings of Gods people, but they uſually and often aſſemble becauſe they know the neceſſitie and efficacie of that buſineſſe for which they aſſemble; they pray much, becauſe they know pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er prevaileth much.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the reaſon why God corrects ſo long, why the ſtroake remaines upon a people. Tis no wonder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lyes, when the wearied are not carefull to heaue it off; for they ſhall ſmart ſtill that ſeeke not diligently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If prayer be the remedie, it then juſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe that ſeeke for other remedies and reſt there; In this inſtance of the peſtilentiall diſeaſe which in theſe parts we feare, we diſallow not the uſe of antidotes, the warding of our Towne-ſhips, the warrantable removall from our houſes; but theſe are not enough, nor ſuch as can giue us confidence. They that truſt upon theſe ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrouſly abuſe an emptie creature, they leane upon a bruiſed deceitfull bull ruſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that neglect prayer. In the practicall noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we doe not eaſily diſtinguiſh betweene the neglect and contempt of holy duties; therefore they adde unto their ſinne that plead for their neglect, I haue not time to anſwer objections; briefly;</p>
               <p>They ſay, God cannot be changed by our prayers, what need we pray?</p>
               <p>But that weapon wounds themſelues: for therefore muſt we pray becauſe God cannot change; it is his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable will to giue us what wee need, and tis his unchangeable will that we ſhould pray that hee would giue it.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:19096:59"/>
               <p>They ſay, good things may bee had, are had without prayer.</p>
               <p>But if they be good, whether are they ſure? But thoſe good things which we receiue by prayer are called <hi>ſure mercies.</hi> Beſides, good things are beſtowed on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked either not for themſelues, or they were better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
               <p>They ſay, men haue often prayed and not obtained that they haue prayed for.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe anſweres, that God oft heares when we apprehend it not, or if he delay hearing it is becauſe he is infinitely wiſe, not becauſe he is any way unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or uncarefull: I would onely oppoſe this; Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue our not hearing, to our owne not praying rightly, when we doe not obtaine, let us ſee whether, nay be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of it, that we prayed amiſſe.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> hath reſolved the caſe, <hi>Yee aske and receiue not becauſe ye aske amiſſe, that yee may conſume it upon your luſts, Iam.</hi> 4.3. Let us make that tryall, it is ſafeſt to lay the blame upon our ſelues. Theſe are weake and falſe pretences, and ſuch as ſhall not refuge our neglect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the Scripture is terrible: <hi>Poure out thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon the heathen that know thee not, upon the families that call not upon thy name. Ier:</hi> 10.25. They that know God will call vpon him, and when we neglect to pray vnto him we forget him, and then we caſt off all feare; as <hi>Eliphas</hi> the <hi>Temanite</hi> ſpake a truth though vnjuſtly in the application vnto <hi>Iob: Thou caſteſt off feare and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayer before God, Iob</hi> 15.4. They that feare God, do pray vnto him not onely publickly, for ſo a carnall man may be drawne vnto a forme, but priuately with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſecret whiſperings, for ſo the Hebrew word in the text ſignifies. When wee neglect this Muſſitation this low, humble, ſubmiſſe repreſentation of our wils, then we caſt off feare, then we expreſſe pride; but by it wee gaine a ſtrong adverſary, God will reſiſt vs, for, <hi>Hee reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19096:60"/> Conſider this yee that forget God.</hi> I'le end with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us ſet upon the exerciſe of prayer, let us make uſe of our priviledge. It is nothing to haue the happineſſe and advantage to prevaile in Court, if wee poſſeſſe ſuch a favour, let us not loſe or neglect our power. Are wee ſerious when wee pray, or is it worth the having which we pray for? then we may conceiue what it is to be heard. How doth it diſcourage a poore client to waite long and haue no acceſſe? But if we pray rightly, God lets us in; for ſo is the promiſe, <hi>God is neere unto them that call upon him, to them that call upon him in ſpirit and truth.</hi> It is all one not to haue a priviledge, and not to uſe it; as I ſhould never account a miſerable wretch that denies himſelfe neceſſities, to be wealthy, though the maſter of a crammed hoord. Prayer is the key that opens treaſures, let us often turne it, tis our owne fault if we be not ſtored. Let us not neglect ſo rich a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, for <hi>by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt wee are made neere</hi> there is a wide entrance made; let us preſſe neere it to get in through Chriſt. Without Chriſt wee are a farre off, but in him we haue <hi>boldneſſe and acceſſe,</hi> ſo that wee ſhall not be challenged for intruſion, but with confidence may get neere to the throne of grace, and like ſervants in ſpeciall favour may haue entrance both private and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Beloved, we under-value ſuch a mercie, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-value Chriſt, if now we neglect prayer. Let us not neglect our ſelues, let us not neglect the Church, let us not neglect the bloud of our Saviour. The times, the danger of the times, the Churches abroad, the Church at home, our owne neceſſities call for our prayers. Let me remember you a ſtorie from the Goſpell which may lead us. When our Saviour with his Diſciples were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea, a ſtorme aroſe, the ſhippe was indangered; whereupon the Diſciples haſten to the Cabin where Chriſt ſlept, and awake him ſaying, <hi>Maſter ſaue us, wee periſh; then he rebuked the wind and the ſea, and there was a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19096:60"/> great calme.</hi> The Ship of the Church is in great danger, the winds are loud, the wayes riſe high, there is a great tempeſt abroad, the waters beate againſt the Veſſell: now our remedie and ſafetie lies in God, let us imitate the wiſedome of the Diſciples: tis likely that the other Mariners uſed other meanes, ſome at the Anchors, ſome at the ſterne, ſome at the pumpe, ſome at ſeverall gables; but the Diſciples they onely runne to Chriſt, and throng about the Cabin-doore, and cry out amazedly and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently to him, <hi>Maſter ſaue us we periſh.</hi> It may bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men in danger will haue recourſe unto other meanes to their owne likelihoods; but it will bee our Chriſtian wiſedome to throng about the throne, to ſeeke God by prayer, <hi>Lord ſaue us we periſh.</hi> Tis our advantage, the Lord will not be offended at our importunitie, we may all throng, though in theſe and the like aſſemblings, but one man employes his tongue unto God, yet the whole Congregation may preſſe unto the Cabin-doore: Let our hearts draw neere, and kneele all together on the threſhold of the Sanctuary; that God may take notice of a multitude of Clients, and may heare: that the ſtorme what ever it is may be appeaſed, and there may follow a great calme, eſpecially in the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and at home.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The arguments he uſed in his prayer; they are two;</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Covenant; <hi>O God of my Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19096:61"/> and God of my Father Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From the promiſe; <hi>O Lord which ſaidſt unto mee, Returne and I will deale well with thee;</hi> The Text needs no other either diviſion or explication; and therefore I may proceede to the arguments particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Argument is from the Covenant, and it ſtrengthens his prayer thus; O God, thou art the God of my Fathers, and therefore mine; thou haſt entered into Covenant with them, and therefore with mee, for the <hi>Covenant is to them and to their ſeede;</hi> I am the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac; O God of my Fathers Abraham and Iſaac, deliver mee.</hi> The head that I will ſpeake of, is, in <hi>Hypotheſi;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Iacob prayed with an argument from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, in <hi>Theſi,</hi> and more proper and profitable for us;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in prayer wee muſt draw argument from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture will giue us precept and inſtance, I will onely confirme it by a double reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wee ſhall not elſe be heard, wee muſt haue the generall Covenant before wee haue particular hearing: for all is offerd in Chriſt, wee muſt come in him, in whom alone we challenge all. A thing muſt be ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pray for it, ours in Gods Covenant to giue it us, elſe though wee doe pray for it, wee ſhall never obtaine it. Now the Apoſtle hath told us, how all things are ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. <hi>All things are yours, and yee are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> The Covenant promiſeth, but the promiſe muſt be firme, elſe wee cannot be confident to receiue; Now the ſame Apoſtle hath againe told us how the promiſe is firme; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>All the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in him are yea, and in him are Amen.</hi> Therefore wee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19096:62"/> muſt come in Chriſt, and to come in Chriſt is to come in the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the Covenant wee are intereſſed in Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which wee honor by our prayer, and from which wee expect benefit. Wee acknowledge God, able, wiſe, good; for otherwiſe wee ſhould not pray unto him. But hence is our comfort, that in vertue of the Covenant, his ſtrength, power, goodneſſe, wiſedome, are ours. <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> was confederate with the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thereupon tells him; <hi>I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horſes as thy horſes.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.4. There was a League between <hi>Iudahs</hi> and <hi>Iſraels</hi> King, therefore the Strength of <hi>Iudah</hi> is <hi>Iſraels</hi> aide: and <hi>Ahab</hi> doubts not of <hi>Iehoſhaphats</hi> company to <hi>Ramoth Gilead.</hi> To contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate God, and to know him in himſelfe glorious, might indeed raviſh us, but rather with wonder than affection: But this both equally cheares us and emboldens us, that as he is ſuch in himſelfe, ſo he is ſuch to us; and that is by the Covenant, wherefore we muſt uſe that argument when wee require his aide. I ſhall haſten from this, and onely make uſe of it in a double Exhortation.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Prayer hath ſtrength from the Covenant, let us therefore enter into Covenant. Chriſt is offerd; when wee take him as he is offerd, wee then enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Wee muſt lay hold on him, not to part with him for any thing; to giue our ſelues up unto him, to be his. Thus let us take Chriſt, let us entertaine the tender, the offer, and upon the termes of the Covenant; then the league is made, Chriſt is ours, God is ours, and we may pray.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Vſe.</hi> When wee are in Covenant, let us make uſe of it; let us be wiſe to catch at ſuch an advantage. It was the wiſedome of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Ambaſſadours from the diſtreſſed <hi>Benhadad;</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.33. They come with humble entreaties to the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for King <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dads</hi> pardon, and did diligently obſerue whether any thing to the advantage of their ſuite would come from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19096:62"/> him, and did haſtily catch it. When they had preſented the Meſſage, <hi>Let thy ſervant Benhadad liue: Ahab</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres; <hi>Is he yet aliue? He is my Brother.</hi> They catch the advantage, and reply; <hi>Thy brother Benhadad.</hi> When wee pray, wee may heare as it were God ſpeaking in the Covenant, <hi>They are my ſervants, my ſonnes;</hi> be wiſe upon the advantage and anſwere, <hi>Thy ſervants, thy ſonnes,</hi> Let us make uſe of thoſe glorious relations, let us make uſe of thoſe gracious attributes, of power, wiſedome, goodneſſe; in a word, let us manifeſt that wee injoy God, by making uſe of God. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelfe with him, and be at peace, thereby good ſhall come unto thee;</hi> ſayth that experienced <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 22.21. And as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>Then ſhalt thou haue delight in the Almightie, and ſhalt lift up thy face unto God. Beloved,</hi> It is our great weakneſſe that wee cannot enough delight in God; it argues that wee know not his treaſure and his readie hand; let us therefore <hi>Acquaint our ſelues with him,</hi> that we may not onely know him, but by an intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may in all conditions make uſe of our God, our Father, our friend. It ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken ſo much of this, for that which I would ſay of the ſecond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment challengeth my time from the former.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond argument is from the promiſe. In that uncomfortable night when the weary Patriarke was forced to reſt himſelfe upon the ground, accompanied onely with his owne ſolitary muſings; God appeard and made him a promiſe of Company and defence: <hi>This Land whereon thou lyeſt will I giue to thy ſeed, and behold I am with thee, and will keepe thee in all places whither thou goeſt, and will bring thee againe into this Land, for I will not leaue thee till I haue done that which I haue ſpoken to thee of. Gen.</hi> 28.13.14.15. This promiſe he now makes uſe of, and with it ſtrengthens his prayer; <hi>O God which ſaidſt unto mee, I will deale well with thee, deliver mee:</hi> I now am confident to beg ſafetie and protection, for thou haſt ſaid it, and I know that thou art true. Beſides this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19096:63"/> inſtance of <hi>Iacob,</hi> wee haue it alſo in the practiſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When the wrath of God waxt hot againſt the idolatrous people, and had threatned to conſume them; <hi>Moſes</hi> remembers this argument, and prayes; <hi>Remember Abraham, Iſaac, and Iſrael thy ſervants, to whom thou ſwareſt by thine owne ſelfe and ſaidſt unto them, I will multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your ſeed; Exod.</hi> 32.13. <hi>David</hi> intended to build an houſe to the glory of the Name of God, but is told by <hi>Nathan</hi> that ſuch a worke ſhould be reſerved for his ſonne to a time of peace, but however God had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his intention, and promiſes to build up and eſtabliſh his houſe: according to that <hi>David</hi> frames his prayer for the flouriſhing continuance of his family: <hi>Let the houſe of thy ſervant David be eſtabliſhed before thee, for thou O Lord of Hoſts haſt revealed to thy ſervant, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe; and now O Lord God, thou art that God and thy words be true, and thou haſt promiſed this goodneſſe unto thy ſervant, therefore now let it pleaſe thee to bleſſe the houſe of thy ſervant.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27.28.29. Thus <hi>David</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged himſelfe in the Lord his God, as it is noted of him in another Hiſtory, in another caſe; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. I might giue you more inſtances that this argument hath beene uſed by the Saints; and for good reaſon; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The promiſes are given for our ſtrength, therefore upon them they haue ſupported themſelues while they haue prayed. Affliction deadens the ſpirit, and would lagge prayer, unleſſe there were a Word; but ſayth the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 119.50. <hi>This is my comfort in my affliction, for thy Word hath quickned mee.</hi> The promiſe quickens, and ſtayes up a lagging yeelding fainting Chriſtian; and like ſome ſtrong warming liquor put into the mouth of a ſwounding man, it recovers the almoſt periſht heate and reviues the halfe-dead ſpirit. When the word of the Goſpel ſaith, <hi>Sonne be of good cheare, thy ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> Then the ſoule beginnes to looke up thorough the eyes, and breaths and gaſpes, and ſhewes now that it liues againe. So it beares up in tryalls likewiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19096:63"/> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doubting leaſt the Hebrewes might be wearied and faint in their minds; at leaſt he intimates this to be the cauſe; <hi>Yee haue forgotten the exhortation which ſpeaketh to you as Children, my ſonne faint not when thou art rebuked, for whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, if yee endure chaſtening, God dealeth with you as ſonnes: Heb.</hi> 12.3.5.6. When a man is corrected, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he faints, for 'tis no pleaſant thing to be under the rod: yet this inables to beare the laſh, to remember, That to be corrected is to be dealt withall as ſonnes. Therefore the Saints haue exerciſed their faith upon the promiſes, whereas elſe they could not ſo eaſily haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven obedience to the Commands; for when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand burthens, the promiſe lifts at the burthen &amp; makes the way ſmooth. You ſhall ſee the difference of the Command and promiſe in one example of <hi>Gideon. Iud.</hi> 6.14.15.16. God meanes to deliver the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the <hi>Midianites</hi> oppreſſion by <hi>Gideons</hi> hand, and therefore ſends a Meſſage to him; <hi>Goe in thy might, ſaue Iſrael, haue not I ſent thee?</hi> The command ſtartleth him though he were a valiant man. He ſhrinkes, and expoſtulates; <hi>How ſhall I doe it? my family is poore, in a ſmall Tribe, and I the leaſt in the family: how ſhall I deliver Iſrael?</hi> Now the promiſe follows the Command; <hi>Surely I will be with thee, and thou ſhalt ſmite the Midianites as one man.</hi> This puts a life into him, and now onely when upon tryall he is ſure, it is a promiſe, he hath courage enough to be an undertaker of that great Commiſſion. For this reaſon haue the Saints remembred the promiſe, and uſed it in their prayers as an argument, becauſe it is their ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They knew, God muſt be honored if they would expect that God ſhould honour them with hearing: Now to uſe the promiſe is to honour God; It honors his goodnes that he ſhould pleaſe to be ſo reſpectiue of man, it honors his truth, that he will ſurely make good his word, it honors his power, that he is not leſſe able to doe than ſay, it honors his wiſedome, that he could before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19096:64"/> fit his people with conveniences. Ile not ſtay you longer upon the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that <hi>Iacob</hi> did, that the Saints haue done ſo: But, in <hi>Theſi,</hi> wee may draw this uſefull and comfortable Doctrine;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Gods promiſes muſt be the ground or ſtrength of our Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To omit other proofe, wee may confirme this with a double reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No prayer can elſe be made with faith, with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with comfort: for wee muſt ſee the thing made ours by promiſe before we aske it: <hi>This is our confidence if wee aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.14. And, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. The promiſe being made in Chriſt, <hi>in him wee haue boldneſſe and acceſſe with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by the faith of him.</hi> For what haue they to doe with God or Gods fulneſſe, that are <hi>ſtrangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of promiſe? Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. Such can challenge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and though they hold up a petition, they cannot looke to haue it ſealed, or Gods <hi>Fiat</hi> ſubſcribed under it. But <hi>David</hi> comes to beg as it were for his owne, which was onely treaſured up by God againſt his uſe; <hi>Lord where are thy former loving kindneſſes, which thou ſwareſt unto David in thy Truth? Pſal.</hi> 89.49.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though God freely promiſe, yet he will not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily performe his promiſe, till it be ſought by prayer. <hi>This deſolate place</hi> (ſayth God) <hi>ſhall become like the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden, I the Lord haue ſpoken it, and I will doe it. Thus ſayth the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael to doe it for them: Ezek.</hi> 36.36.37. This ſame method is cleared by <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in that great worke of the <hi>Iewes</hi> returne from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie; God will doe it, but they muſt pray; They muſt firſt pray and then God will doe it. <hi>After ſeventie yeares be accompliſhed at Babylon, I will viſit you, and performe my good word towards you, in cauſing you to return to this place;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19096:64"/> then ſhall you call upon mee, yee ſhall goe and pray unto mee, and I will hearken unto you, yee ſhall ſeeke me and finde mee, when yee ſhall ſeeke for me with all your heart. And I will be found of you, and will turne away your Captivitie. Ier.</hi> 29 10.12.14. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.25.26. God will haue this courſe taken, that when wee receiue the promiſes, wee may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg them to be as they are, gifts rather than debts, beſtowed not earned.</p>
               <p>I haue haſtned my ſelfe to the application. Let us make uſe of this argument; let us mooue upon this ground. <hi>Motus</hi> muſt be <hi>ſuper immobile;</hi> Tis ruled in Philoſophy, That Motion muſt be upon ſome firme thing, ſomething that is immoveable. Now prayer is a motion, in it the ſoule aſcends to God, and therefore it muſt be firmed upon ſome ſtedfaſt thing; ſuch is the promiſe, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid in his laſt words, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>He hath made with mee an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure.</hi> The foote ſlips not when it treads upon this, tis ſure ground. Let us walke upon this ground, let us uſe this argument, wee ſhall ſpeed and prevaile. <hi>Quintilian</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome rules for Oratory, tells us, That if our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be not weightie, wee muſt then heape many little ones together, like a bed of ſand, where though every particular graine of duſt could not be diſcerned, yet the whole heape makes a great bulke, <hi>Congregandaſunt quia minima:</hi> but wee need not ſay ſo of this argument, for it hath ſtrength in ſtead of many; he brings an heape of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that prayes with a promiſe. But that I may proceede in this diſcourſe to your benefit, I will divide this application into two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Direction how wee may.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Exhortation that wee would make uſe of the preſent argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Direction; Theſe three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How wee muſt be rectified in our judgements concerning the promiſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How wee may collect them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:19096:65"/>3. How wee muſt apply them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How our judgements muſt conceiue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in their nature, exhibition, and intention, I ſhall cleare in ſeverall propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning their nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The kindes of promiſes differ; Some are abſolute, ſome onely conditionall; So are temporals; for we finde <hi>Iob</hi> afflicted, <hi>Lazarus</hi> poore, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe tempted: yet there are promiſes againſt diſeaſe, againſt povertie, againſt temptation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Promiſes are oft times ſubordinate, and as they are made, ſo alſo performed in order, ſucceſſion, and dependance. <hi>The Lord is a Sunne and a ſhield, the Lord will giue grace and glory to them that walke uprightly: Pſal.</hi> 84.11. Firſt grace, then glory, ther's the order, the ſubordination.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Promiſes in themſelues are certaine and firme, but in their performance oft hid and undiſcernable, and ſuch as come not to paſſe but by Gods wiſedome and power. The promiſe is, <hi>The redeemer ſhall come to Sion, Eſa.</hi> 59.20. That the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall be converted, is in it ſelfe a certaine word; but a divine Power muſt bring it about. The <hi>Iewes</hi> are rebellious, and <hi>becauſe of their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie are cut off; God ſpared not the naturall branches;</hi> But ſayth the Apoſtle; <hi>If they abide not ſtill in unbeliefe they alſo ſhall be graffed in, for God is able to graffe them in againe: and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, as it is written; There ſhall come out of Sion,</hi> (or to <hi>Sion) the deliverer, and ſhall turne away ungodlineſſe from Iacob:</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah, Rom.</hi> 11.23.26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning their exhibition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All promiſes to the Elect, are made and performed in Chriſt; they were purchaſed by him, and by him are adminiſtred. Therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> thus pleads his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; <hi>As God is true, our word toward you was not, yea and nay; for the Sonne of God Ieſus Chriſt, who was preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you by us, was yea; for all the promiſes of God in him
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19096:65"/> are yea, and in him Amen:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.19.20. And more directly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now to Abraham and to his Seed were the promiſes made: he ſaith not, unto Seeds, as ſpeaking of many, but as of one, And to thy Seed which is Chriſt.</hi> Which is, either becauſe they are made for his ſake and merit, or becauſe unto us in Him as our head; To Him properly and primarily, but <hi>In aggregato,</hi> and ſo to us; wee haue elſe no intereſt in them, nor any title to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The time of promiſes is oft unknowne and long dated, and as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>The Viſion is yet for an appointed time. Hab.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Abraham</hi> was but ſeventie fiue yeares old when he had a promiſe of Seed; <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3.4. But he was an hundred yeares old before he had a ſonne: <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.5. And though there were a promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> when the Scepter was departed from <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> yet under the Empire of <hi>Caeſar</hi> there was an old man <hi>Simeon wayting for the Conſolation of Iſrael. Luk.</hi> 2.25.26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning their Intention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every promiſe whoſe <hi>medium</hi> is generall (though made to ſome particular perſon) is generall, and applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all. The promiſes are Centered in Chriſt, and therefore all that belong to him, haue all thoſe promiſes belonging unto them. At the dedication of the Temple <hi>Salomon</hi> made a prayer, and among other petitions, this; <hi>If there be in the Land famine, if there be peſtilence, if their enemy beſiege them in the Land of their Cities, Then heare thou in heaven.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.37.38. God promiſeth <hi>Salomon</hi> to heare. The promiſe was to <hi>Salomon;</hi> yet when the multitude of Confederate enemies from <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> were encamped at <hi>Engedi; Iehoſhaphat</hi> makes uſe of that anſwere for his owne ſafetie. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.8.9. Compare alſo the Lords promiſe to <hi>Ioſuah, Ioſh.</hi> 1.5.6.7. With the Apoſtles application to the <hi>Hebrewes. Hebr.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame promiſes may belong to the godly and wicked, but diverſely; to thoſe by Covenant, to theſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19096:66"/> by common bountie. Though all haue poſſeſſion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yet not the Tenure: wicked men haue no Right but onely a generall providence, therefore the intention of the promiſe is not from particular ingagement. Thus our judgements muſt be rectified; Lets now ſee;</p>
               <p n="2">2. How wee may collect them. Wee muſt ſo col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the promiſes as God hath made them. In reading the Scripture wee ſhall finde the difference; they are ſometimes propounded;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Expreſſely, and then 'tis more eaſie to gather what is plainely delivered; and theſe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Generally. So the promiſes are ordinarily made; with ſuch generall termes of <hi>Every one,</hi> or, <hi>Whoſoever,</hi> or the like, that all that are qualified may with that eaſe collect them; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> gathered <hi>Manna</hi> which was ſcattered about all their Tents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Particularly; ſuch as were made to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, as <hi>Abraham, Ioſuah, David,</hi> or the like; theſe wee may collect if wee finde our ſelues in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for then they are intended unto us, as being made to the condition rather then the man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Implicitely; theſe being ours more darkly, are not embraced with ſo much eaſe; but theſe alſo wee may two wayes collect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the examples of the Saints; what wee finde really performed to any of them, being of a generall <hi>Medium;</hi> is a reall though not written promiſe, and wee may collect it to our uſe, that God will doe ſo with us as with them, if neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the prayers of the faithfull; when they haue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for any thing, and haue beene heard; their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their Suite is a tacite promiſe unto us; Such were heard in what they ſought for, and wee know, God is alike ready to heare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee haue learned what to judge of the promiſes and to gather them. It remaines to know, how we muſt apply them. The direction unto that, follows upon the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19096:66"/> ground that wee haue formerly layd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of their nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the kindes differ, wee muſt differently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them; The abſolute abſolutely, Conditionally the conditionall. The promiſes of Iuſtification, and of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in a meaſure fit for our journey, wee may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely apply; becauſe the ſpirit of life and grace is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all that muſt be ſaved. But that meaſure of grace which our alone-Conceit reaches at, and ſpeciall tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls with their meaſure, wee muſt apply but with limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe promiſes are ſubordinate, wee muſt not Anticipate them in the application. Though that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> be true, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>That godlineſſe is profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all things, having promiſe of this life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> Where the forenamed order is not obſerved; yet our Saviour hath interpreted it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the ſubordination in that admonition; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>But firſt ſeeke the Kingdome of God and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> We muſt take the promiſes in Connexion; firſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; firſt grace, then glory; Will yee haue ſafetie and not haue <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Or can wee looke to be glorified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are ſanctified? There muſt be a ſeeking of Gods kingdome firſt, and then temporalls are added.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the promiſes (though firme) are ſometimes hid in their performance; therefore in the applying of them, wee muſt liue not ſo much by reaſon but by faith; and becauſe a divine power brings them to paſſe, wee muſt meaſure Gods truth by his power, becauſe wee know that to be infinite wee muſt beleeue this to be ſure. Our doubting of Gods truth, proceeds from this, that wee are not enough perſwaded of his power; and therefore the <hi>Iewes</hi> reaſon againſt that, when <hi>Moſes</hi> brought a promiſe from God, that they ſhould be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with meate: They ſpake againſt God, ſaying, <hi>Can God prepare a table in the Wilderneſſe? Behold, he ſmote the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19096:67"/> rocke that the waters guſhed out, Can he giue bread alſo? Pſal.</hi> 78.19.20. They acknowledge God could doe much, but they limited him in his infinitenes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hardly can beleeue <hi>Moſes.</hi> So when the Prophet promiſed the next dayes plentie, the Courtier diſputes the power; <hi>Though God ſhould open the windows of heaven, yet how could this thing be?</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.2. But wee muſt not meaſure God by our ſelues, his power by ours, for he is able to put life into the dryed bones, as he taught it to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in a Viſion: <hi>Eze:</hi> 37.10.11.12 13. We are ready to ſay in our deſpaire; <hi>Our bones are dryed, our hope is loſt, and wee are cut off for our parts; But thus ſaith the Lord, Behold I will open your graues, and put my ſpirit in you, and yee ſhall liue.</hi> Wee muſt ſo looke upon the promiſes and upon our ſelues, when they ſeeme to be loſt, and wee hopeleſſe; God can accompliſh them and quicken us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of their Exhibition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the promiſes are made and performed in Chriſt, therefore wee muſt be in Chriſt that wee may apply them. The promiſe is the Saints inheritance, but the inheritance is ours not ſo much as wee are heires as Co-heires together with Chriſt, in whom our happines is founded; and the promiſe of life and juſtification is to the unrighteous that thirſt after the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and reſolue to obey him. Therefore wee muſt be found in him if wee make any claime, or deſire an application.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the time is not alwayes ſet but with a long date; wee muſt therefore waite for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, becauſe though long, yet the Word is ſure; as the Prophet ſpeakes in the place before alleaged: <hi>The viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeake and not lye; though it tarry, waite for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi> It was preſumption for the Diſciples to aske; <hi>Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdome?</hi> And therefore they are checkt by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19096:67"/> now to ready to aſcend; <hi>It is not for you to know the times or the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his owne power. Act.</hi> 1.6.7. It was enough for them, that they had beene charged before, <hi>That they ſhould waite for the promiſe of the Father.</hi> Wee muſt ſtay the time; <hi>Yee ſhall reape if yee faint not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: Promiſes are not preſently ripe, wee muſt ſtay till the harveſt. Grudge not that the wicked flouriſh, that the Antichriſt of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſtill exalted; theres a promiſe of his fall, and when the Harveſt comes he ſhall be cut downe. Murmure not at wants, or that the cauſe of the Goſpell not enough flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, theres promiſe of mercy, when the harveſt comes it will yeeld a full crop. See an excellent reſolue in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; Pſal.</hi> 119.81.82.83. <hi>My ſoule fainteth for thy ſalvation: but I hope in thy Word. Mine eyes fayle for thy Word, ſaying; When wilt thou comfort mee? for I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like a Bottle in the ſmoake, yet doe I not forget thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</hi> He had longing expectations, languiſhed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dryed up with a delayed hope; yet ſtill he ſtayes the time of the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard of their Intention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that promiſe which hath a Generall <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> is Generall; though it were made to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon; therefore wee muſt ſee our ſelues reduced to the condition of ſuch particulars for our application. If a promiſe were made to <hi>David,</hi> if to <hi>Paul;</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is ours if wee in the ſame condition. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being made, not to their merit, but to their want; therefore if wee be in <hi>Davids</hi> or <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtreite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, though wee haue not ſo much grace, yet having as much merit, (that is, none:) and being in that caſe wee may apply it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the promiſes of Temporalls doe belong unto us the Elect, not onely by common bountie as to the wicked, but by ſpeciall Covenant as being made ours by Chriſts purchaſe; therefore wee may ſo apply them. Thus outward things being acceſſions to us, we
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19096:68"/> may confidently looke for enough of them; and make uſe of our Tenure, for wee hold them by a good claime.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I haue done with the former part of the Vſe, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection how to uſe this argument of the promiſe; This other is an Exhortation that wee would make uſe of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us make this Vſe, to ſtore up the promiſes againſt the time of our need: let us treaſure them as oyle in our Lampes, that wee may not want light with the fooliſh Virgins. Learne to poſſeſſe the Word, and make it our owne, that it may dwell with us for our conſtant aſſiſtance. Men keepe their Conveyances and Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Deeds, with a great deale of care; let us be ſo wiſe for our Soules, for our comfort, <hi>that the Word may dwell richly in us in all wiſedome. Col.</hi> 3.16. That was <hi>Davids</hi> care; <hi>Thy Word haue I hid in mine heart. Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Salomon</hi> adviſeth us to that, and giues us good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tye them about thy necke; When thou goeſt it ſhall lead thee, when thou ſleepeſt it ſhall keepe thee, when thou awakeſt it ſhall talke with thee: Pro.</hi> 6.21.22. He ſpake it generally of the Word, but it is principally conſiderable of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that will leade us on with a gracious ſafetie, that will keepe us with happie ſecuritie, that will talke unto our memory with ſweet and pleaſing Communication. Let us enrich our ſelues with ſuch a treaſure, and hoord up all, though wee ſee not the preſent uſe of ſome, yet let us be wiſe in our choyce, as well as provident in our heape, to ſtore up ſpecially, the moſt precious, the moſt fundamentall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us make a conſtant uſe of what wee haue ſtored up, and to that end learne clearely to diſcerne their truth and their goodneſſe, that the promiſes are not vaine nor in vaine. It was the witneſſe of <hi>Samuel</hi> concerning his Prophecies, That <hi>Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground:</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.19. God will not let his word fall, to be ſcattered or loſt; nor let us looſe a promiſe. Haue wee the full
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19096:68"/> Breaſts of Scripture, and will wee be wanting to our owne comfort? Rather let us deale as wee haue ſeene ſome Children hang at the Dug, and being hungry and therefore full of appetite, and ſtrong and therefore not ſoone wearied, haue rather tugged than ſuckt at the breaſt, not giving over till they haue drawne that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall veſſell dry; So, according to the Prophets alluſion, Let us ſucke and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that wee may milke out and be delighted: <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.11. Our comfort is, wee cannot draw the Scripture dry; there is milke enough; promiſes of every kinde.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Generall promiſes; lay hold on them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Pertaining to this life;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the ſpirituall eſtate;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Promiſes for Iuſtification and forgiueneſſe. <hi>Sonne, be of good cheare, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee. Mat.</hi> 9.2. Apply it. Lord, I drooped upon my former apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſin and wrath, I was left then without all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; But this voice makes me looke up cheerily, when I heare a word in my Conſcience, <hi>That my ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given mee.</hi> Againe; <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him returne unto the Lord, and he will haue mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundantly pardon. Eſa.</hi> 55.7. Apply it. Lord, I haue many ſinnes, but thou haſt more mercies; my ſinnes would carry mee with deſpaire from thee, thy mercies invite mee to returne to thee; I haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in my ſinnes, and thou haſt promiſed abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pardon. I haue multiplyed my ſinnes, but thou art rich in mercy, I dare now oppoſe a treaſure againſt a treaſure, the treaſure of thy mercy againſt the treaſure of my ſinnes. I am confounded to ſee my ſinnes heaped up to heaven, but thy Mercy is high as the Heavens and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-tops them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Promiſes for ſanctification and our cleanſing, <hi>I will ſprinkle cleane water upon you, and yee ſhall be cleane, from
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19096:69"/> all your filthineſſe and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you; a new heart alſo will I giue you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and will giue you an heart of fleſh. Ezek.</hi> 36.25.26. Apply it. Lord, thou haſt promiſed, not onely to juſtifie my perſon, but to ſanctifie my nature, I am unholy, doe thou make me cleane by the ſprinklings of thy grace, I am old, doe thou renew mee by thy ſpirit, I am hard and perverſe, doe thou make mee ſoft and pliant to the motions of thy will.

Lord, thou haſt promiſed, to forgiue mine iniquitie, and to cure my diſeaſes; thou canſt as eaſily change my heart and make mee holy, as bid mee that I ſhould be holy. Take away my crookedneſſe and reluctancie, giue mee a connaturalneſſe to thy Commands, a ſtrength to obey thy will, that I be no back-ſlider.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are promiſes concerning the Temporall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For ſupply of what is good. <hi>Seeke firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and his righteouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.

Outward things are but Acceſſions; wilt thou giue us the maine, and deny us what is leſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy? While wee haue the Inheritance, wee are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of theſe things, together with the Inheritance. Thou wilt not ſee us periſh with povertie, with want, becauſe wee are Subjects, becauſe wee are ſonnes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Yee ſhall dwell in the Land that I gaue to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I will call for the Corne and will encreaſe it, and lay no famine upon you, and I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the encreaſe of the field. Ezek.</hi> 36.28.29.30. Apply it. Lord, thou haſt promiſed plentie beſides neceſſitie. I may now quiet my ſelfe in every condition with firme expectations for proviſion, for if thou call for the Corne I ſhall haue abundant encreaſe. Riches, honour, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19096:69"/> health, ſafetie, are at thy Command. If thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, the tree, the field ſhall be fruitfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Promiſes alſo for remoovall of all things evill. <hi>Call upon mee in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee. Pſal.</hi> 50.15. Apply it. Lord, thou art my Sunne and my Shield, affoording not onely light and influence, but ſafetie, but refuge. The ſame Command of thine both calls for good, and driues away evill. This preſent peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is thy ſervant, Command it that it neither come neare our dwellings, nor ſtay in the dwellings of our neighbours; for ſo thou haſt promiſed to deliver when wee call.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>I might inſtance theſe Applications more largely, but I rather leaue but onely Taſts; onely let us endevour to incourage our ſelues with the like, and learne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God. Some doe promiſe what they cannot make good; ſo did Satan to our bleſſed Saviour when he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the glory of the world: Some promiſe deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully what they meane not to performe; ſo <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> dealt with <hi>Hamor</hi> about their ſiſter <hi>Dinah.</hi> In God there is neither impotencie nor faithleſneſſe, he is able to make good to the utmoſt, and he will not deceiue our hopes. <hi>Phocion</hi> in an Oration at <hi>Athens</hi> compared <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> in his promiſes to the Cypreſſe Trees, which are fayre and fruitleſſe. Some men are like thoſe tall, ſtreight, and beautifull trees, of ſplendid and promiſing tongues and behaviours, that draw mens eyes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations on them; but deceiue, and when we come neare them they appeare meere emptineſſes. But confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19096:70"/> is not fruſtrate which is placed upon God. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fig-tree, (like that our Saviour ſaw and curſed on the high way) when wee come to gather fruit, may ſend us away with hungry appetite. But faith while it plucks at Scripture, receiues to ſatisfaction, that tree though the fruit be ripe it ſtill hangs for the weary paſſenger, and in Winter when other trees are naked, robbed of their beautie, it continues to haue fruit and leaues, food and ſhade, a ſuiteableneſſe to the conditions of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, whether they be hungry to giue them nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or weary to giue them refreſhment. Oh let us truſt the promiſe what ever it be, for now God that is abundantly free, yet hath made himſelfe a Debtor, that wee may now not onely begge, but challenge. If wee would pray and ſpeed, neglect not ſuch an argument which giues quietneſſe in and continuance to our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and in the want of other Rhetoricke and Oratory, urge this with repetition, <hi>Lord, Thou haſt promiſed; Thou haſt promiſed.</hi>

                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We will begin with the truth delivered, which as it hath two parts, will afford them to us for doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obſervations. The firſt is this;</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:19096:71"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a broken and contrite heart or ſpirit is Gods Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will appeare very uſefull, when we haue it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, confirmed, and applied.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the explication of it, three things are to be cleared.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is the heart and ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What it is to be broken or contrite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is a ſacrifice, or how this is called Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Text will not allow a large and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall diſcourſe of the heart and Spirit, that were to wrong the intention of the place, and the time that I haue to ſpend; but for our preſent purpoſe it will bee needfull to know but thus much;</p>
               <p n="1">1, That the heart notes the Soveraigne power of the ſoule; it ſits with a ſcepter and commands the whole man; it not onely ſets on worke, but ſeaſons all our workes, and therefore the rule is, that every worke hath <hi>tantum virtutis aut vitij, quantum voluntatis.</hi> And the very place of its reſidence ſhewes its government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeated in the middle of the body; if at leaſt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a great <hi>Etymologist</hi> bee warrantable, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the contract of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be derived of the hebrew word <hi>keneb, Medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit notes the actiue power of the ſoule, that which executes the reſolutions of the former; and therefore in our uſuall way of ſpeaking, we call an actiue man, a man of ſpirit. But here I thinke both words doe ſignifie one and the ſame thing, the ſoule of man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider it organically, and ſo call it the heart; or in-organically, and ſo call it the ſpirit: but howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we expreſſe it, it is the ſoule of man which muſt bee fitted for Gods ſervice, to be ſuch a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſoule muſt bee broken and contrite; which though in a curious notion they may be diſtinguiſhed,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19096:72"/> yet I here conceiue them to expreſſe the ſame thing, the thorough humiliation of the inward man. You will all diſcerne that the words muſt not be taken properly, for none will imagine that that fleſhy part, the heart, muſt be divided or broken in peices or bruiſed, for that were to make a dead man, in ſtead of a living Sacrifice; wee muſt neceſſarily then underſtand the ſpeech to be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, and that <hi>David</hi> uſeth a metaphor; that the ſoule in reſpect of its humiliation before God, muſt bee as a thing bruiſed and broken into peices. Or it may farther ſignifie the degrees of humiliation; there muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a breaking, but a contriting a pounding unto duſt. The heart is naturally ſtony, proud, ſtiffe, and rebellious, but it muſt be beaten from its owne height, and layd le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and flat before Gods foot-ſtoole; it muſt be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and lie bleeding before God, it muſt ſhake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his preſence, and therefore the <hi>Italians</hi> haue a word that is apt to expreſſe this, <hi>Scheggiare,</hi> of <hi>Scheggia,</hi> a looſe leaſe, or a paper by it ſelfe when the booke is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. The ſoule muſt be as it were unbundeled, it muſt be ſhaken and looſe; a ſcattered and ſhivering thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſoule, when it is thus ſeparated into peice-meales, then it is Gods Sacrifice. Sacrifices were Gods ſervice in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> manner of worſhip; they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and broken when they were offered; But theſe were Ceremoniall Services; the Morall ſervice that God now requires is rather a broken heart then a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Beaſt, yet there is a reſemblance in this unto that, and it is called <hi>Gods ſacrifice,</hi> becauſe it is ſuch a Service as is ſuiteable unto him. Offrings in the Law, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expiatory or Dedicatory, our true humiliation in ſome ſence is both, while wee weepe over Chriſt, who is our Expiation, and dedicate our ſelues to God in a full entire and ſincere ſervice. The inward man muſt be truely humble, and this is Gods ſervice, the Sacrifice that wee offer.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:19096:72"/>2. Having thus explained it, wee are to confirme it by Argument;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such humiliation is, and is called Gods ſacrifice, becauſe God himſelfe is the Author of it, he onely breaks us and fits us for his owne Altar. Tis true, that Croſſes may make us lye downe, they may humble us, but God muſt make us humble. Vnleſſe God ſanctifie the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee may be ſtubborne under the burthen, and fret againſt that hand which wee ſhould at once ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with ſubmiſſion. Yee know the Story that a rocke guſhed forth waters, it was ſtrange, that waters ſhould flow out of an hard ſtony Rocke; but the rocke was ſmitten, and then it flowed. But could a ſtroake breake a Rocke? or could the Rod cauſe the dry ſtone to yeeld forth moyſture? Nay, the cauſe was Gods Command; God bid <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtrike and then the waters flow. When the power of God accompanies the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and ſanctifies the ſuffering, then the heart of man breakes kindly; and that may well be called Gods, when he prepares his owne ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This humiliation is ſuiteable to God, and therefore both is Gods ſacrifice, and is ſo called.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such ſervice is ſuiteable, becauſe it is ſincere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſpirituall: The giving of the heart notes truth in the Offring, and that is it which God requires, which he taught the <hi>Iewes</hi> when he commanded them to giue him the fat and the intrals of Beaſts that were ſlaine. The heart notes unfainedneſſe; for the body may be perſonated in taking on a different ſhape, the heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: a man may appeare to be another man by the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his garments, but he is the ſame man inwardly in his heart and in truth what ever his habite ſpeake him. He that giues his heart, offers a fit Sacrifice; ſuiteable, becauſe both ſpirituall and unfained.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the heart is ſuiteable in regard of ſinceritie, ſo brokenneſſe is ſuiteable, in regard of the manifeſtation of humilitie: And it is convenient that wee ſhould fit
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19096:73"/> our ſelues unto thoſe relations wherein wee conſider God, to come into the preſence of our Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne bending, into the preſence of our Iudge, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; into the preſence of our juſtly-offended yet gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly-accepting God, bleeding, wounded, broken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For a third reaſon it may alſo be called Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, becauſe it doth him ſpeciall honour; in a double reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What wee giue him; Our hearts, our ſpirits. Whom wee honour, wee preſent with gifts, and by the greater gift wee expreſſe the greater honor; and what greater preſent can wee giue him than our ſelues. The Chriſtian offers more to God, than the <hi>Iew</hi> was wont. It was no ſuch great matter to offer a Lamb, or a Ramme, or a Bullocke; they that were rich might ſpare them, the poore in many caſes were not enjoyned to it; but however they did but offer ſomewhat out of their fold; wee offer what is of greater price, and brings God more honor; The better part of our ſelues, our very ſelues, our hearts and ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How wee giue them Broken. It is not ſo much the gift as loue and eſteeme in the gift, that honours, now wee doe witneſſe our loue by our ſorrow; and ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to that diſtinction which the Schoole hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us, wee expreſſe a twofold ſorrow, appretiatiue, and intenſiue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Appretiatiue ſorrow diſcovers it ſelfe to the honour of God; when wee ſhew at what a rate wee ſet Gods favour, that to revenge our ſelues for loſing of it or loſing at leaſt our actuall apprehenſion of it by our ſinne; wee roughly and ſeverely handle our beſt part, and wrecke our diſpleaſure upon that which wee hold deare and precious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Intenſiueneſſe of our ſorrow honours him and is witneſſed; that wee not onely afflict our hearts for the diſhonoring of our God, but doe afflict them with deep wounds, even to brokenneſſe and contrition.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:19096:73"/>
               <p>I'le not longer ſtay upon Confirming of this truth, but deſcend eaſily to the Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If the divided wounded ſpirit, the broken heart be Gods ſacrifice; wee learne a myſtery, That there is a Man-ſlaughter lawfull, not onely lawfull but profitable, but convenient. Eſteeme it no Paradoxe, for I call not for ſelfe-murther, nor Preach like ſome of thoſe <hi>Romiſh Incendiaries</hi> for Bloud; but in this ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is no crueltie, no inhumanitie. I bid you not kill your ſelues, as that dreaming <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> or the more deſperate <hi>Pſeudo-Meſſiah</hi> in the parts of <hi>Tranſilvania;</hi> but call for that death whereby you may more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably liue. We muſt be ſo broken, in the apprehenſion of the breaking of Chriſts body for us, as if we were under the ſame wrath; this the <hi>Iewes</hi> learned, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to lay their hands upon the head of the Beaſt which was ſlaine, as a witneſſe that the deſert was theirs, and that in juſtice their owne bloud ſhould be drawne by the Sacrificers knife.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If the Broken heart be Gods Sacrifice, it condemnes the unbroken in heart as being no fit Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. There are many that come unto theſe buſineſſes of our publique faſting and humiliation, that bring not their hearts with them; for if the heart were preſent there would be affections preſent with the heart, ſuitea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the buſineſſe wee haue in hand. Where men haue no ſence of their miſery, no ſorrow for their ſinne, no hungring after pardon; it is an argument their hearts are not preſent. If your hearts were here, there would be moyſture in your eyes, tenderneſſe in your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, zeale in your prayers. Where is your ſenſibleneſſe, your ſorrow, your ſighing, your zeale, nay where are your hearts? If ſuch as bring not broken hearts are condemned, much more ſuch as bring not their hearts at all; ſuch onely come for company, and fill the Church with dead Carcaſſes, that haue no life in their ſervice, no heart unto the worke that they performe. Will yee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19096:74"/> mocke the holy preſence? Will yee come to Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar without an Offering, without a Sacrifice in your hands? As if while <hi>Aaron</hi> were killing a Beaſt, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould throng about him, and gaze on meerely for Curioſitie. So yee deale when yee preſſe hither, if yee bring not your hearts with you, yee haue nothing to doe here; either bring Offrings or croud not the Altar. But I meant not to deale purpoſely with theſe, but with ſuch as if they doe bring their hearts, yet unbroken, ſo it Reproues;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as are inſenſible of ſinne, that though many blowes are layd upon them, yet feele them not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill hard and unbroken, like Anvils that endure the Hammer. When wee diſcover ſinne, and denounce judgements againſt the ſinnes that wee diſcover; wee beſtow our blowes upon the Conſciences of offenders, and purpoſely that wee might Hammer them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape; but there are many though they lye under the ſtroake, and are directly under the reprehenſion, yet are not made ſenſible that thoſe ſinnes are theirs, that thoſe threatnings are to them, that they are the men. If men were broken, they would be ſenſible, as <hi>Ioſiah</hi> was when he heard <hi>Shaphan</hi> reade the Booke of the Law which the Prieſt <hi>Hilkiah</hi> gaue him; he rent his Clothes, ſent his Courtiers to enquire the farther decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Writing, becauſe he ſaw that great was the wrath of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as are not open to Confeſſion of ſinnes argue that there is no breach made upon their ſpirits. You know, a Veſſell though it be full of liquour, yet if there be no breach it lets none run forth, but if it be broacht it hath a free vent. Man is a veſſell that containes much, and is fild with a filthy pudled poyſonous water; ſome of that remaines in ſuch as are ſanctified and waſhed by regeneration, therefore it is their continuall care to emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie themſelues, and make wide leakings that they may freely powre themſelues forth before the Lord. But I
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19096:74"/> feare I may too juſtly accuſe you; who is it that in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate can lay out his ſinne in the preſence of God? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions come hardly from men in the publique; wee that are your mouths in theſe more common ſolemne duties cannot freely enough confeſſe your and our ſinnes enough to the ſhaming of our ſelues, doing it as if wee would rather ſhew our memories in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of ſinnes, and our wit and Oratory in painting them; then our true and unfained Contrition in being affected with them; But if ſometimes wee ſpend a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time upon this neceſſary and neglected duetie, you ſoon grow weary of our length, and by your carriage diſcover that you thinke us tedious, and that leſſe time might haue beene ſpent with more profit. Ah! <hi>Beloved,</hi> how juſtly may our private devotions be ſuſpected, when wee dare ſhew our ſelues weary in the publique? Which of us is wont to ſpend an houre or more upon our knees in the acknowledgement of thoſe many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which wee might eaſily acquaint our ſelues withall, when there is no witneſſe to obſerue it but the eye of God? I call your Chambers, your Cloſets, your beds to witneſſe againſt you, your unbroken hearts. For if wee were truely broken, there would be vent both frequent and forcible; ſo <hi>David</hi> powrd himſelfe out in this Pſalme, when the ſence of his double ſinne had made a Breach upon his ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly ſuch, as, though Broken, yet are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, not ſhivered into peices. Men may be bruiſed and yet not ſo divided that one peice is taken from another, that the frame is diſſolved. <hi>The Devils may beleeue and tremble: Iam.</hi> 2.19. And wicked men haue often trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; So did <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo did <hi>Baltaſar,</hi> ſo did <hi>Faelix;</hi> but the frame of their evill hearts was not taken aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; they returnd againe after the fit to be the ſame men that they were before, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> returnd againe to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, <hi>Baltaſar</hi> to his Cups, <hi>Faelix</hi> to his fingring of Bribes; they were tough and remaind whole ſtill.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19096:75"/> Some men are ſometimes ſtartled at a Sermon, when wee ſpeake judgement, and lay it home cloſe to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they wake and begin to looke up; but like men halfe aſleepe and halfe awake, they ſoone fall againe to their ſlumber. A Drunkard that upon ſuch an occaſion as this, heares the odiouſneſſe of that ſinne layd open, together with the danger; may for the preſent begin to bethinke himſelfe, what a courſe he runne, and whither it is like to leade him, upon this he ſtartles, and begins to reſolue, He will follow that ſinne no longer. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution it may be holds as long as the faſt holds, or it may be till the next day or longer; but then he meets with ſome knowne Companion, falls to his ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, forgets that he was yeſterday at a faſt, or that he ever heard that Drunkenneſſe was a ſinne. Here was a little breaking, but no ſhattering of the heart; the frame of the ſinne was not broken; the peices, the joynts, were not taken aſunder from one another; and therefore he eaſily returnes to what he was, and is after the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, after the Faſt, juſt ſuch a one as he was before it. Theſe all come under the ſecond application, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of ſuch as are not broken-hearted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Vſe.</hi> If the broken-heart be Gods Sacrifice, let us be exhorted to this labour, to labour for broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite hearts. The people of God haue beene of ſuch a temper, to omit other examples ſee one, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and in his owne words: <hi>Mine heart within mee is broken; becauſe of the Prophets all my bones ſhake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome; becauſe of the Lord, and becauſe of the words of his holineſſe; for the Land is full of Adulteries: Ier.</hi> 23.9. If <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in the apprehenſion of the ſinnes of others, were ſo tender, that he did ſhake with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and ſtaggered as not able to retaine his ſtrength; how ought wee to be moved with the conſideration of our offences againſt almightie God? Let us witneſſe to our ſelues the unfainedneſſe of our humiliation, by the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19096:75"/> intenſneſſe of our ſorrow, by the breaking of our hearts; which that wee may the better be guided in, I ſhall ſet before you the ſeverall Metaphors which without ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wee may conceiue the minde of <hi>David</hi> may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto; The breaking up of ground, the breaking of ſtones to duſt, the dividing of their Sacrifices.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The phraſe of a Broken heart, may referre to the breaking up of a ſtiffe ground, and the Harrowing of it for the bruiſing of the Clods. Let us plow up our hearts, according to that of the Prophet; <hi>Breake up your fallow ground, and ſow not among thornes: Iere.</hi> 4.3. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame of another Prophet; <hi>Sow to your ſelues in Righteouſneſſe, reape in mercy, breake up your fallow ground. Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. Let us uſe good Husbandry upon our ſelues, and beſtow Tillage, that wee may bring forth fruit to God. Wee are naturally ſtiffe ground, and full of ſtones; barren and unfruitfull. <hi>Beloved,</hi> there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of this Husbandry, for yee cannot be profitable hearers of Gods Word, unleſſe yee be broken-hearted. If a man ſhould throw abroad his ſeed, before the plow hath made furrowes to receiue it, he ſhould looſe all that he doth ſcatter; if the ground be hard the ſeed enters not, but lyes open to be pecked by every bird. Men are deafe to Gods Commands, till their hearts be opened. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> had a ſtiffe diſpoſition, and though ſo many judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments came in a throng, he was not broken by any of them, and therefore hearkens not to the meſſage of the Lord, but peremptorily rejects it, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him?</hi> But the Broken heart hath an open eare; which wee obſerue in men in their ſeverall conditions: While a man frolicks away his time and life in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant way, enjoying health and vigour, not being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſickneſſe or other infirmities; he puts off the thought of death and an account that muſt be made, and thinkes that ſuch ſad meditations and admonitions are not fit for a man of his activitie and reſolution; but when God caſts him upon his bed, and makes him begin
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19096:76"/> to apprehend that he is a man, a poore, weake, fraile, ſickly man; and that he now at length ſees what it is that followes upon ſinfull pleaſure, but eſpecially when he lookes into the graue where he feares himſelfe muſt ſhortly be layd, and ſees under the graue Hell and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then he breakes, and now he can finde an eare; if Miniſters, if religious friends diſcourſe unto him, he hearkens, and begins to learne what thoſe new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought-of myſteries meane. This is liuely in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the converted Iaylour; <hi>Act.</hi> 16.29.30. When God had broken his heart; Then <hi>he called for a light and ſprang in, and came trembling, and fell downe before Paul and Sylas; and brought them out, and ſayd, Sirs, what muſt I doe to be ſaved?</hi> It is likely that the Iaylour if he had not been a rough man in his naturall temper, yet his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calling might make him rough; before that time <hi>Paul</hi> might ſpeake long enough and he not regard him, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> might ſing in the priſon and he take no notice, unleſſe to threaten them and command their ſilence; but now that God had ſhaken him with the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake; he is now greedie of inſtruction. His minde did not formerly run upon it, how he might come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but now haſtily, violently, tremblingly, he enquires it, <hi>What ſhall I doe to be ſaved?</hi> Naturall men care not for preaching, they wonder that people ſhould goe ſo much to Sermons, ſhould be ſo much in Conference; but when they come to be broken, to be wounded in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Then, Oh what inſtruction? What comfort can yee giue us? Let this be our care, to ſtirre the earth, and let the Harrow follow the plow, breake the ſtiffe clods, the proud thoughts that are built againſt the Kingdome of Chriſt; then yee are fit for ſeed. Wee are Gods ſeedeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and when wee preach wee ſcatter the ſeed upon a Congregation; but wee loſe our labour where we meet with ſtony hard ground: plow up your hearts, that the Word may the better fructifie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Metaphor may be from the breaking
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19096:76"/> of Stones, and pounding them to duſt, to make a plaiſtry worke. A man cannot alter the faſhion of an hard ſtone with his hand; but when it is made into plaiſter the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can make it into any frame. Wee haue ſeene the ſhape of a Lyon, or an Horſe, or Beare, or any thing elſe made of ſtone, when it hath beene firſt broken and made and tempered into a ſoft Morter. Wee are naturally ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, men of ſtony hearts, and are not pliant to the Image of grace, till broken into ſmall peices, and grounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall powder. But, ſayth <hi>Ieremy, My heart is broken within mee;</hi> and then he was fit to lament for ſinne. Wee muſt uſe Maſonry as well as Husbandry, wee muſt be ſoft for impreſſion. A man cannot make the print of his Seale if he ſet it upon an hard wall; but the ſtamp leaues it ſelfe upon a peice of Waxe: Now wee muſt be Waxe in the hand of God, and Waxe you know is Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctible; if I held a round flint, I could not by cruſhing it with my hand make it flat or ſquare, or draw it out unto a length; but a peice of ſoft Waxe might be moulded to any faſhion, made round or flat, or ſquare, or drawne out to any length. If ever wee haue Comfort, wee muſt be of ductible, following diſpoſitions, to be ſuch as Gods dealing is towards us, to be faſhioned by his rod unto humilitie and ſubmiſſion, by his mercy unto thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and prayſes; To be, not what wee are, or of our ſelues would be, but willingly what he will haue us be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But laſtly, The phraſe in the Text doth principally allude to the Breaking of the Sacrifice; and we may find the Metaphor in taking notice of two Offrings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Offring of Incenſe, where the Command was that the Ingredients ſhould be beaten to powder, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.36. A perfume ſmells ſweeteſt when 'tis bruiſed or cruſht; and when wee are ſtamped before God in the ſence before declared, wee yeeld a pleaſant ſavour to his Noſthrills.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sacrifice of Burnt-Offring; the Beaſt was cut in peices and burnt unto aſhes. There muſt be a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19096:77"/> of the heart, as we reade of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.10. <hi>That he divided the Sacrifices and layd one peice over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another.</hi> Our ſervice of humiliation muſt be open and ſincere, that nothing may be hid from God, as the Beaſt though wee cannot ſee it within, while it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, but when cut aſunder wee may perceiue all the intralls and the heart and the liver, and all the ſecreter bowells, whether the Sacrifice be ſound. Oh let us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt our ſelues ſo truely humbled, that the bloud of our Sacrifices may be powred out before God, ſuch a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was that Congregation, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. of whom the Story witneſſeth, that they were <hi>Compuncti cordibus, pricked in their hearts: Peter</hi> had preached unto them Chriſt Crucified; <hi>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts and ſaid, Men and brethren what ſhall wee doe?</hi> Sinne runs freely in the veines of every man, too abundantly freely in them that are of a plethoricke ſtate, and therefore Bloud-letting cannot but be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Let me preſcribe you that Phyſicke now, and what ever Phyſitians will tell you of the extreame heate of this preſent weather, and of the ſigne, yet take the word of a Divine for the preſcription, who dares warrant eaſe unto your ſoules in this courſe. I haue done with the firſt Doctrine that I propounded, <hi>That a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart and contrite Spirit is Gods Sacrifice:</hi> The ſecond is this:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>That ſuch a Sacrifice of a Broken-heart,</l>
                  <l>God will not deſpiſe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>There is more in that phraſe than the words ſeeme to deliver, <hi>God will not deſpiſe,</hi> that is, <hi>God will accept.</hi> He is pleaſed with ſuch a bruiſed Offring, as wee haue it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in a comfortable promiſe in the place before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged concerning the Incenſe; <hi>The pure and holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume muſt be beat very ſmall, and put before the Teſtimony in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, where, ſayth God, I will meet with thee: Exod:</hi> 30.36. The <hi>Septuagint</hi> reads
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19096:77"/> it, <hi>Whence I will be knowne to thee;</hi> And the Chaldee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe thus; <hi>Where I will appoint my Word unto thee.</hi> Both ſetting out Gods gracious acceptation of ſuch a Service. Beſides, the Word of the Text doth enough confirme it; The broken heart is called <hi>Gods Sacrifices,</hi> the conſtruction is better in Divinitie than in Grammar, a word of the Plurall is uſed, as if he would ſhew us, that this contrition and humiliation is in ſtead of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther legall Sacrifices. Will yee ſee it yet clearer in a word of promiſe; <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rent your hearts and not your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and turne unto the Lord your God, for he is gratious and mercifull, who knoweth if he will returne and repent, and leaue a bleſſing behind him.</hi> But if this leaue it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that of the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> will remoue our feares; <hi>To this man will I looke ſayth the Lord, even to him that is poore and of a contrite ſpirit, that trembleth at my Word. Eſa.</hi> 66.2. They are happie upon whom God lookes, where he beſtowes the eye of his favour. That great God who beholds the proud afarre off, as if he knew them not; he lookes after the Contrite, or lookes to him, (as the word is in the Prophet) he affords acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and hath reſpect unto his ſtate. And becauſe the Broken-hearted are caſt downe and diſmayed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; therefore another promiſe is expreſſe; <hi>For thus ſayth the High and loftie one that inhabiteth eternitie, whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to reviue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the contrite ones. Eſai.</hi> 57.15. The teares of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> were received and prayſed; The <hi>Publicans</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtriking of his breaſt was obſerved at the dore of the Temple; The bitter weeping of <hi>Peter</hi> after his ſinne was remembred; <hi>God deſpiſeth not ſuch;</hi> did he accept the poſſeſſed <hi>Magdalen,</hi> the notorious <hi>Publican, Peter</hi> the denier, when they were now blubbered, and had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beautie, but that beautie which their teares gaue them? And will he reject us? Will he reject us when wee come in the ſame poſture? Nay he will not deſpiſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19096:78"/> ſuch <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> ſuch <hi>Sacrificers.</hi> It needs not a farther proofe, I haſten to a briefe Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It learnes us how God and the world differ in paſſing their Cenſure and affection. Carnall men make ſport at the broken-hearted, and deride their contrition. While <hi>David</hi> mourned like a Doue on the houſe-top, you may heare himſelfe complaining how he was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.10.11.12. And in another Pſalme, he pictures forth in his owne caſe the very liuely image of a man mortified; <hi>That he was powred out like water, and all his bones were out of joynt, that his heart like Waxe was melted in the midſt of his bowells, his ſtrength was dryed up, and his tongue cleaved unto his jawes;</hi> he was ſo macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they might tell all his bones. Now he was a ſpectacle for gazing worldlings; as he was his own tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was their wonder, they knew not what to make of him; <hi>They looke and ſtare upon mee, ſaith David;</hi> and when he was now downe, they were readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure him, and gaped upon him with their mouths, with words both of ſcorne and threatnings. But in this caſe, God otherwiſe eſteemes him, as himſelfe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it; <hi>He hath not deſpiſed nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he cryed unto him, he heard. Pſal.</hi> 22.14.15.17.24. God deales not as a falſe friend who hides away his face from his brothers extremitie, or is deafe to his Complaints when he is brought low: but favourably reſpects and cheriſhes thoſe that walke ſadly in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of their ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It affords us great incouragement to draw neare with our Offering, when we know that God will not deſpiſe it. Wee are now equalled with the Richeſt who can bring moſt into Gods Treaſury, and are able to bring the fayreſt and fatteſt Sacrifice to Gods Altar, theirs ſhall be but accepted, and ours which is the ſame priviledge, ſhall not be deſpiſed. He that hath nothing to giue but himſelfe, if he giue himſelfe, giues what
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19096:78"/> God requires of him: for he calls for the Heart, and the Apoſtle hath told us what wee may preſent; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>I beſeech you that yee preſent your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> But chiefly this Offering is acceptable, when the heart is contrite, for ſaith the Lord, <hi>to him that is poore will I looke.</hi> Let not our unworthineſſe diſcourage us, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine theſe or the like Scruples: Will God looke upon ſuch poore abject worthleſſe Wretches? If I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Service, would he not contemne both it and me? If I were more worthy, I would then draw neare him: as I am I dare neither ſue for entertainment nor expect it. Away with ſuch proud reaſonings, ſuch ſhewes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie: would wee be challengers rather than beggars? But if wee truely ſee our ſelues vile, and are as low in our conceits as our words pretend; wee ſhall haue the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt acceſſe; and ſhall ſooneſt receiue becauſe wee beg. Thus much of the firſt part of the Text, <hi>The truth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> The time calls mee off, that I can adde but a few words of the ſecond; which alſo if I had time, would not naturally afford many.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The manner of delivering of that truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a Meditation; <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In an Ejaculation; <hi>A broken and contrite ſpirit, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He contemplates a comfortable paſſage, and then ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up himſelfe in a quicke and ſpeedy recourſe to God. Let us ſo learne to Reade, to Heare, then wee ſhall reade and heare with profit, and not more with profit than with comfort. Reade and Breath toward heaven; God hath breathed on the Scripture, if wee would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the divine will, wee muſt breath againe to God. Our ejaculatory prayer may haue a conſtant and ſpeedy entercourſe betweene God and his revealed will; when wee heare a Meſſage from heaven in our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary attendance upon Preaching, wee may ſpeed to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19096:79"/> God in the very Act of Hearing, that God would cleare ſuch a myſtery, faſten ſuch a notion, lay neare ſuch an application. When wee reade the Scriptures, let us me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, and pray, that what wee meet with which may be ſuiteable to our condition, may be cloſely applyed and made ours. Methinkes it fits the ſtate and life of a Chriſtian to be much in meditation, and as much in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſpecially in this uſe of it, The darting of the thoughts, for it argues acquaintance. The ſolemne prayer may be for a forme onely, and ſo wee may deceiue our ſelues in exerciſing of it; but this ſhewes wee are acquainted with Heaven, when our recourſe thither is familiar and frequent. When wee are to deale with ſtrangers, our Negotiation is attended with Ceremony of behaviour and ſpeech; But upon all occaſions wee can viſite and ſpeake to an intimate friend. I would not haue reverend and trembling demeanour neglected in our moſt private Acceſſes to the infinite Majeſtie; yet let us uſe our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, to be often with God, to liue much in Heaven, to be ſparkling upward; winging up our ſoules in an heavenly converſation, at once beſtowing our thoughts upon what is holy, and our prayers to the Holy One.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rayer is likely to gaine Audience, when wee come ſtored with arguments from the covenant and promiſe: when wee come qualified in our ſelves with ſuch contrition. But there is ſtill another duty which refers to this head, that as our wiſdome leads us to prayer for our ſelves; ſo our charity muſt direct us to pray for others, without which wee cannot be aſſured that wee ſhall be heard in our ſuits. I have therefore now againe attended upon <hi>David,</hi> in the method of his double petition.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here is much worke laid out for a little time, and therefore that I may not injure the Text, nor defraud you of any part which naturally flowes from it; I ſhall endeavour to follow every part: and becauſe every part, therefore very briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hee that prayes, is <hi>David;</hi> upon which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I have given my thoughts leave to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with three Obſervations, naturall and uſefull.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Obſervation or Doctrine; that, <hi>The ſpirituall eſtate hath its changes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſame <hi>David</hi> who was formerly ſo dejected that hee ſcarce dared to pray for himſelfe, now hath gotten courage to pray for others. Who could ſpeake more droupingly, more abjectly, than hee in the former part of the Pſalme? Hee calls for mercy, and having no hope in any thing but mercy, he onely is bold becauſe he ſees a multitude of mercies, and thoſe tender ones likewiſe, <hi>According to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</hi> But now he is raiſed from that dejectedneſſe, and dares look up to God in the behalfe of others. Hee was often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch changes; ſometimes we heare him ſaying, as if hee were already dead with the feare of death; <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul:</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time wee may heare him triumphing, as if hee had a ſtrength beyond his ſtrength; <hi>I will not feare what man can doe unto mee.</hi> It was likewiſe the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times languiſhing under his torments he curſes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of his birth, &amp; chafes with every one that ſpeaks; at other times, conquering his pain, he can diſpute ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the uncomfortable Arguments of his froward Viſitants. I'le inſtance but in one more, in <hi>Peter;</hi> hee is ready now in the ſtrength of his faith to leap over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord to walk upon the Water, but preſenly begins to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19096:80"/> ſinke, and then hee trembles, becauſe of little faith: at one time hee is couragious for Chriſt, and draws his weapon in his defence; at another time, he ſhamefully denyes him. So that it is with our ſoules as many times with our bodies; ſometimes wee finde our ſelves full of life, active, apt for buſineſſe, merry, witty, pleaſing to our ſelves and others: ſometimes dull and indiſpoſed, unapt for any thing but ſleep, troubleſome to our ſelves, and a burthen to our company. So, ſometimes wee can pray with life and zeal, at other times fitter for a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than Devotion: ſo alſo in other duties. And the Reaſon may, among others, be double.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ground of diſtemper remaines in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian; a relique of nature, and a principle of grace, which ſtrive againſt one another, and from that conflict is this diſtemper, this change. That as where the vigour of youth, and the remainder of a diſeaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the body of a man, hee is often ſickly and oft a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine well; not kept in his bed, becauſe of his vigour and naturall ſtrength, yet not in perfect health, becauſe hee is ſtill ſtrugling againſt the diſeaſe; ſo is the Chriſtian, there are in him contrary principles, both are working; in ſome things nature prevailes, in ſome other, grace; and the man for the preſent changes to the ſide that hath the victory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe beſides that ground within, hee meets with changes from without. When wee ſo much uſe the Creature, that wee ſurfeit upon the uſe, then wee grow diſtempered in our better part, wee grow very dull in our holy ſervice; but when againe wee awaken our thoughts, and ſet our joy on God, then we are more lively to his ſervice. The ſoule apprehending ſin, growes ſad, apprehending mercy, it then takes comfort; ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it walks dumpiſhly or cheerfully. When we meet with ſtrong temptations, which not only foile but overthrow us, wee goe on diſmaid, yeelding, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the conqueſt; when wee meet with power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19096:81"/> encouragements, wee finde our ſelves lightned, and now, if not able yet willing to live as Angels rather than men.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this will be profitable, for inſtruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, incouragement, and exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. It inſtructs us in three profitable truths. 1. In the difference of the eſtate of men carnall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. Men meerly carnall are alwaies diſeaſed, and their diſeaſe continually working; but the regenerate, though they have ſome qualmes, yet the ſincerity that is within, works forth the diſtemper againe. Sickneſſe in an old man overcomes him, becauſe there is not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heate to encounter it; but though ſickneſſe may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal a young able luſty body, the natural ſtrength encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and prevailes againſt it. Such a principle of grace is ſtrong &amp; working in the regenerate, that drives out the poyſon which may be any way received; and ſincerity (like a fire under a Veſſell of water) boyles out and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth away the ſcumme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It inſtructs us to the diſcovery of thoſe who are of the beſt temper, ſuch namely as have the feweſt Changes in their ſpirituall eſtate. It argues much health and an excellent temper and furniſhment of grace, when wee are conſtantly diſpoſed unto good; for ſo much diſtemper as there is, ſo much nature. Thoſe Chriſtians then are very happy, that are ſtill equall, that have a ſcale of their paſſions which are equally and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably balanced in all conditions, whereas in ſome the ſcales are never or ſeldome even, but ſometimes their feare weighs downe the reſt, ſometimes their ſorrow, ſometimes their joy, ſometimes their anger. But they are happy that have a ſweet and even tune ableneſſe, and come neereſt unto perfection; as, if there were an exact ſymmetry and proportion of Elements in Elementates, there would not be a diſſolution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It gives us a little to look after the happineſſe we ſhall have in heaven: there wee ſhall have no ill health,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19096:81"/> no diſtemper; but ſhall meditate and praiſe God free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cheerfully, as the Angels doe. Here wee complaine often, our Heads, our Teeth pain us, our bellies, our all parts are afflicted; ſo wee complaine of blindneſſe in our underſtandings, of deadneſſe in our affections, of rebellion and perverſeneſſe in our wills; that we can do nothing as we ought to doe, as wee deſire to doe: But there ſhall be no complaining, no cauſe of complaining, wee ſhall bee freed from changes, from the grounds of our changes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. It reproves two ſorts: 1. The unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bold, ſuch, as if their ſtrength could not bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, nor they change, dare venture upon any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Like young men that were never acquainted with ſickneſſe, they will goe in any weather without feare of the extremities either of heate or cold, and venture upon any diſh, what ever the Phyſitian preſcribe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their ſtomackes are hot and able to digeſt them. Such are the forward venturings of ſome, upon any buſineſſes, upon any company, upon any recreations, not conſidering how eaſily they may diſtemper them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and, if not loſe their integrity, yet forfe it their comfort.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It reproves, ſuch as are ready to cenſure others for their faylings, that cenſure them for no Chriſtians, becauſe not lively or ſtrong ones. Men may bee dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſicke, and yet ſtill alive; let us bee charitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Brethrens infirmities, for they are not to be concluded dead as ſoon as diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 3. It ſpeakes incouragement to them that are ſad-hearted when they find not themſelves anſwerable to what they ſhould be, to what they have been. Some feare their eſtate is not good, becauſe not alwaies right; They complaine, they could have wept at a day of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, trembled at a judgement denounced, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a comfortable promiſe: but now they cannot, or at leaſt not ſometimes. Indeed, heer is matter for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19096:82"/> our humbling, for our deeper humbling, but not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire; for though there bee diſtemper, there may yet be life: which likewiſe proves it ſelfe by this, that we are but ſometimes ſo; whereas if we were dead there would be no ſtirrings at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 4. Laſtly it exhorts us to live phyſically, to bee much in obſervation what our temper is, how wee are diſpoſed: let us bee carefull and fearefull of our ſelves, labouring to bee much acquainted with the ſtate of the ſoule, how wee thrive, or whether wee impaire in our health: let us not venture on ſuch things as may bee hurtfull for us, but chooſe what is wholeſome; that we may be good Phyſitians to our ſelves, and as much as may be, hinder our diſtempers.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond obſervation is this; that, <hi>The aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mercy for our ſelves, makes us confident to begge mercy for others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> was almoſt affraid to prefer his own ſuit. Hee begs humbly, but hee begs in faith, and beleeves his ſin is pardoned, as may appeare by the very manner of his praying, and continuance in it; but now hee ſpends not all in his owne behalfe, but remembers <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and becomes her advocate in the ſame Court. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe hee was Gods friend, that was his aſſurance; therefore he intreats for <hi>Sodom</hi> and her profane and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious inhabitants. Then, we may be bold, till then, not: and for this Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Becauſe there is no ground of confidence for others: for while ſinne lies upon the conſcience unpardoned, it makes men tremble. Can a Malefactor pray for a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor? With what face could a thiefe indicted at the Bar, intreat the Judge to bee favourable to another thiefe that ſtands at the ſame Bar with him? Wee muſt have Relation to, and Intereſſe in him to whom wee prefer a ſuit of that nature. If we were to deale with a Stranger, to make requeſt to him about any matter, wee firſt uſe the mediation of an acquaintance or friend to make our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19096:82"/> entrance; much more when we negotiate with an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. How ſhall they that are Strangers, that are adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to God, hope to ſpeed? Let me apply it briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. This ſhewes you the reaſon of that method which you may obſerve to bee ordinarily uſed by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and others in their prayers, eſpecially on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe of our meeting to faſt and pray; Wee firſt humble our ſelves unto the duſt, and call for pardon upon our unfained ſorrow and repentance; and then we proceed to remember others, to pray for the Church, to beg mercy for the diſtreſſed, then wee entreat for <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi> and our other neighbour Counties, for whoſe ſake we aſſemble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. It ſhews us what unprofitable, unſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men thoſe are that are carnall and unregenerate; they have no intereſſe in heaven, they have no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to appeare before God, and therefore have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to be helpfull to their brethren. They oft make a great ſhew in the world, as if they were able to doe ſomewhat; but they are like ſome vain-glorious Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who when they come down into the Countrey, talke what power they have with my Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> my Lord <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> with my Lord, my Lord, and fill their ſpeech with great names, and ſometimes of the Kings Majeſty himſelfe; but indeed they are obſcure unknown men, they have no intereſſe in his Majeſty, they have no power at Court at all: Such are Unregenerates, they have no knowledge, acquaintance or power in the Court of Heaven, they cannot prefer one Suite if wee ſhould need them. Such, upon whom God hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the pardon of their ſins, ſuch are the onely power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones. Wee pray for plenty, and they conſume: Wee pray for continuance of health, and they enjoy it: they are of themſelves unprofitable to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Countrey wherein they live; nay, very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſuch as would bring down plagues &amp; judgements, if God were not mercifull to the elect, &amp; unto them for their ſakes.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:19096:83"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 3. Let us therefore labour for aſſurance of God's favour, that our ſinnes bee freely pardoned, that ſo wee may bee profitable to others, and with confidence may pray for them; which we cannot unleſſe our ſelves be righteous, for the promiſe is but to ſuch; that <hi>the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the righteous man prevailes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The third Obſervation is this; that, <hi>Mercy to our ſelves makes us compaſſionate towards others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> might have ended his prayer at the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Verſe, but having received mercy, he is mercifull to <hi>Sion.</hi> Gods children deſire not to fare well alone, but would have mercy imparted. Which they doe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they apprehend by their owne caſe how ſweet and behoovefull mercy is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe graces are not alone, but where a living faith is, there is a working charity: where there is faith to lay hold upon mercy, there will bee charity to deſire others may bee partners in it: I'le but touch at an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. It ſhewes us the reaſon why the godly pray ſo much for others; they are oft in their family prayers: in their more private prayers, they pray for their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for their children, for their ſervants, for their friends, for the Pariſhes wherein they live, becauſe they know what mercy is, whereas carnall men are ſenſeleſſe of it. They have taſted the ſweetneſſe and comfort of having ſin pardoned, of having Gods favour; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſire that ſuch whom they love, might feele and enjoy the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. It diſcovers the uncompaſſionate to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned. If yee can live in a family, and never pray for it; if ye can beget children and never pray for them; it is a great ſigne that you your ſelves never enjoyed true mercy, but ſtill lye in your ſinnes, without either pardon or peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 3. Let us therefore as an argument of our owne happineſſe, and for the increaſe of our true comfort, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19096:83"/> the example of <hi>David,</hi> be mercifull unto, &amp; mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of others. I have ended my thoughts on the firſt circumſtance implyed in the Text; who it was that prayed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond part is, For whom <hi>David</hi> prayes; for the Church, ſet forth by theſe two names, <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> They were diſtinct, yet when the Scripture names One, it underſtands Both; and when Both, but One and the ſame thing, the Church: which <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a member of, prayes for. That Obſervation which I would make uſefull to you, is but this one:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That 'tis fit the members of the Church, ſhould pray for the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saints have beene wont to doe ſo, as I might ſhew you by many inſtances, if it were not an unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpending of the time, to them that are acquainted with Scripture Story; but I will rather confirme it by Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is fit, becauſe ſo while we pray for the Church, we are wiſe for our owne particulars, and pray for our ſelves; for in Homogeneous bodies every part is the ſame with the whole.</p>

The Commiſſures, Joynts, Nerves, Tendons, are all to this purpoſe; the Bonds and Relations, Religious, Civill, Oeconomall.

It deſervedly reproves the ſenſeleſſe, that though they name themſelves members of the body, yet are not ſenſible of the bodies paine. A piece of wood may bee proportioned to the ſhape of a leg, and ſo faſtned to the body, that it is uſed as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but it feeles no paine though the whole bodie bee diſeaſed, no, not if you prick the thigh or knee, the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt parts unto it, yet it feeleth not, becauſe it is but a woodden Leg. They manifeſt themſelves ſuch, that are not afflicted with the Church, or not affected, men that live but onely to themſelves. It is a bad Motto, <hi>Sibi na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, ſibi vivit:</hi> for they are but meer pieces of earth that are borne to themſelves, that live onely to themſelves. Yet ſuch is the courſe of the carleſſe among us, they minde onely their profits, or their ſports, attending ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly to the Plough, or, which is worſe, to their horſes, to their dogs, or to their pots, and in the meane while have no care or thought of the Church, or how it goes with the common cauſe.</p>
               <p>Will yee take notice of that fearfull imprecation of the Prophet <hi>David? If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.

How juſtly might that curſe befall our forgetfulneſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? Wee deſerve that theſe hands of ours which wee ſtretch to heaven, ſhould wither, and bee made unable for any motion: that theſe tongues with w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we ſpeake to one another, with which wee complaine our wants, and call to heaven for mercy, ſhould be made dumbe, and cleave (for want of moyſture) to the roofes of our mouthes: that ſeeing wee neglect to ſpeake for <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:19096:84"/> we might not be able to ſpeak for our ſelves.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The morall conſideration of the Situation of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> will give us ſome motive to remember it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was ſited (though not exactly, yet in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall account) in the middeſt of the holy land, and the knowne world. That may note the perfection of the Church, the Centre to which is a confluence of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lines from the Circumference, The Sun that cuts the Aequator, and in the midſt of the Firmament is the worlds beauty, The heart that being principall in its ſoveraignty hath a principal place for its operations, The navill that tyes and knits together the veines and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtruments which meete there; all tending to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the perfection of the Church, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if for no other reaſon, yet challengeth our memory; beſides, that all who ſhall be ſaved muſt meet together in the boſome of the Church, without which there is no ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was Hilly, therefore called <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and the phraſe is uſuall of going <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So is the Church in the time of the Goſpel deſcribed by <hi>Micah; But in the laſt daies it ſhall come to paſſe, that the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lords houſe ſhall bee eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and it ſhall bee exalted above the hills, and the people ſhall flow unto it; and many Nations ſhall come and ſay, Come, and let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, and he will teach us of his waies; for the law ſhall go forth of Sion, and the word from Jeruſalem, Micah</hi> 4.1, 2. So likewiſe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 87.1, 3. <hi>His foundation is in the holy mountaines: Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O Citie of God.</hi> But that which is our motive is in this, that becauſe hilly, therefore it is ſtrong above the reach of malice, and we may find ſafety in it; <hi>for the Hill of God, is as the hill of Baſan, an high hill as the hill of Baſan:</hi> and in another Pſalme; <hi>Hee hath built his Sanctuary like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19096:85"/> high Palaces, like the earth which hee hath eſtabliſhed for ever, Pſalm.</hi> 78.69. Our ſafety lyes in this, that we are in the Church as in a defenced place, and muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſerve it as a fort or garriſon wherein we lye entrencht. Beſides, it is that high ſafe Roade, which leads us unto heaven; that as the Valley of Gehinnon lay under <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo, the way of life is <hi>Above</hi> to the wiſe, that he may depart from <hi>Hell</hi> beneath; as <hi>Solomon</hi> applyes it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were formerly two ſeverall Cities, One was in <hi>Benjamins</hi> Lot, the other in <hi>Judahs; Sion</hi> which was <hi>Judahs,</hi> continued in the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> hands till <hi>David</hi> was King, who by conqueſt made them both one; according to that in the 122. <hi>Pſalme, Jeruſalem is builded as a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is compact together.</hi> The Church likewiſe is now but One, ſince Chriſt came, the Conquerour; there is no partition wall, but <hi>Jebuſites</hi> and <hi>Jewes</hi> both inhabite together; as the Apoſtle ſpeakes; <hi>Now in Chriſt Jeſus, yee who were ſometime farre off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt; for hee is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken downe the mid-wall of partition betweene us, Epheſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. All have now an intereſſe in the Church; and it being but One, wee are bound to pray for it by one common bond.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſide the Situation, the prviledges of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> may afford us ſome motives: the priviledge;
<list>
                     <item>1. Of Sovereignty.</item>
                     <item>2. Of Holineſſe.</item>
                     <item>3. Of Love.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It had the priviledge of Sovereignty, it was <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put</hi> and <hi>Sedes Imperii,</hi> the Metropolis of the Land, <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tribes goe up, the Tribes of the Lord, for there are ſet Thrones of judgement, the Thrones of the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſalm.</hi> 122.5. The Church hath ſuch a Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Chiefe of all Societies, the Princeſſe of all other Monarchies: for, all that are of the faith, whereſoever they dwell, yet are free of that, as the mother City. The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19096:86"/> 
                  <hi>Reubenites, Gadites,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſites,</hi> who had their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> were fearful, leſt in time to come, the reſt of the people of <hi>Iſraell</hi> ſhould ſay, What have yee to doe with the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Therefore they build an Altar in remembrance of this, that they might not loſe their right in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they were free, and of the kindred, though they had their dwelling beyond the flood, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 22.22, 23, 24. The Church is the head Citie to which all the Nations flow, built upon Common ground, and to which all beleevers have a claime, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes; <hi>Yee are no more ſtrangers and forreiners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, and are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chiefe corner ſtone, Epheſ.</hi> 2.18, 19. And who will not pray for the head City of the Nation to which hee doth belong?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The priviledge of holineſſe was alſo great; for, <hi>thither the Tribes went up, unto the Teſtimony of Iſrael, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord, Pſa.</hi> 122.4. And Gods houſe was there, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> adds in the ninth Verſe, <hi>Becauſe of the houſe of the Lord our God, I will ſeeke thy good.</hi> So it is called by <hi>Micah</hi> in the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and by <hi>Iſayah, Iſai.</hi> 2.3. And the Evangeliſt calls it, <hi>The holy City; Mat.</hi> 4.5. The Church now is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe holy, as <hi>Joel</hi> prophecied of it; <hi>Yee ſhall know that I am the Lord, dwelling in Zion my Holy Mountaine, then ſhall Jeruſalem bee holy, Joel</hi> 3.17. Therefore, let it bee our reſolution, becauſe of the houſe of the Lord, to ſeeke the Churches wel-fare. But this motive will appeare more in the next.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The priviledge of Love which is manifeſted to the Church,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God dwells there: <hi>Hee refuſed the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Joſeph, &amp; choſe not the Tribe of Ephraim; but choſe the Tribe of Judah, the Mount Sion which hee loved, Pſal.</hi> 78.68. <hi>David</hi> further expreſſeth it, that God dwells
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19096:86"/> there with delight; <hi>For, the Lord hath choſen Sion, hee hath deſired it for his habitation; This is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell, for I have deſired it. Pſa.</hi> 132.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God appeares there, and in that, the Buſh that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but was not conſumed was a type of Gods appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Church, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2. <hi>I will goe now,</hi> ſaith <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſee this great ſight, why the Buſh is not burnt; And God called unto him out of the middeſt of the Buſh.</hi> The place where <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, was called, the Land of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah, becauſe of Gods appearing, where hee made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowne unto his people: <hi>In Judah is God knowne, his name is great in Iſrael, in Salem is his Tabernacle, Pſa.</hi> 76.1, 2. If wee would ſee God wee muſt waite upon him in his worſhip, we muſt viſit him in his holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for to his Worſhippers hee ſhewes his face, and makes known his glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To it hee makes gracious promiſe; and to others in it for her ſake. <hi>I will abundantly bleſſe her proviſion, and will ſatisfie her poore with bread; I will cloath her Prieſts with ſalvation, and her Saints ſhall ſhout alowd for joy, Pſalm.</hi> 132.15, 16. Is not this an evidence of love? But further; See <hi>David</hi> deſcribing Gods love in ſtirring up the peoples thankfulneſſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 147.12, 13, 14. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O Jeruſalem, praiſe thy God O Zion: for he hath ſtrengthned the Barres of thy gates, hee hath bleſſed thy children within thee. Hee maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat,</hi> Shall God witneſſe his love, and wee our neglect? If wee bee not conſcionable in the duty, let us at leaſt be wiſe, to favour whom the Lord reſpects. As it is therefore fit for the members let us pray for the Church, for with this only motive I will leave both the exhortation, and this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Text, for whom <hi>David</hi> prayed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third part is, What hee prayes for;
<list>
                     <item>1. For the Churches Reſtauration.</item>
                     <item>2. For her Continuance.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> prayes for the Churches Reſtauration, <hi>That
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19096:87"/> God would doe good unto Sion;</hi> for his former ſinne had brought an harme upon it, and God was offended. I would briefly make this uſefull in two Obſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt Obſervation. <hi>That ſinne is of ſo publike an harmfull nature, that it reacheth, beyond the perſon that ſinneth, unto others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> ſinned, and his people ſuffered: &amp; we obſerve in Scripture, both; That the Sinne of a Prince hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to his people; as in the Caſe of this <hi>David;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his pride, a peſtilentiall diſeaſe leſſened his number; and hee confeſſeth himſelfe the cauſe of the ſlaughter; <hi>Lo, I have ſinned and done wickedly, but theſe ſheepe, what have they done?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. And the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtory reſolves the Judgements that came on <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> unto the ſinnes of <hi>Manaſſeh: Becauſe Manaſſeh the king of Judah hath done theſe abominations; Therefore I am bringing upon Judah ſuch evill, that whoſoever heares of it, both his eares ſhall tingle,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.11, 12. And likewiſe that the ſinne of a people reacheth to their Prince; as <hi>Salomon</hi> a King hath made a grave and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervation; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.2. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of a Land, many are the Princes thereof;</hi> that is, There are often changes, their Princes being cut off by death. To make uſe of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. It ſhewes how hainous is the nature of ſinne, it is like a peſtilence that takes hold and conſumes. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike Writers have diſtinguiſhed of men, that they may be good common-wealths-men, though bad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; but ſurely, according to the truth of the notion, ſuch a one is <hi>malum publicum,</hi> though hee may be <hi>bonus cives;</hi> and what-ever his relation bee unto the Weale-publike, if hee be wicked, he is harmfull; and like a fire that conſumes what is neare him, and would conſume the world, if God were not more abundantly merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Let us then bee carefull that wee harme not ſociety: if we will not bee religious, let us yet be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19096:87"/> Oh ſpare the Countrey, bring not the plague up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, you that live impenitently: bring not upon us a ſwift judgement, which ſo long as your ſinnes are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, we cannot but expect.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Second Obſervation. <hi>David,</hi> that ſinned, prayes. <hi>There is much equity in that, that they which make the wound ſhould provide a plaiſter.</hi> I muſt not weary you, and therefore will name two Vſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. It condemnes a careleſſe generation, that are forward to ſin, but backward to pray. The Drunkards, Swearers, Whorers, Sabbath-prophaners, Worldlings, Oppreſſors, Pleaſure-mongers, and the reſt, ſuch as they, are they that hurt us; but of all others, theſe are moſt backward to come unto our Faſts. Unjuſt cruell wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that without compaſſion can doe injury, but have no hearts to uſe the meanes for prevention of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Let us ſhew our ſelves juſt to the places where wee live; bee ready to ſeeke God, and to uſe all means to pacifie Gods wrath. Let us weep over the ſins that we have committed, &amp; the hurt that we have done by our ſins; and let us uſe <hi>Davids</hi> courſe and method; pray as hee: <hi>Lord pardon our ſins, and hee mercifull to our County.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> prayes for the continuance of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reſtored happineſſe, in theſe words; <hi>Build up the walls:</hi> noting the Churches need, and that her conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here is not perfect; which will give us leave to draw out, and touch upon two briefe Obſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Obſervation. <hi>That the Church ſtands in neede of walls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee need not doubt the truth of this, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the multitude of her enemies, and their great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie at her peace; ſo that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had good reaſon in his time for his care in building: and for that reaſon, the good providence of Almighty God hath taken a courſe for his peoples ſafety, to wall them about, that his ſpouſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19096:88"/> might bee a garden encloſed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12. a Vineyard compaſſed round with an hedge, and ſtrengthned with a Tower built in the midſt of it, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 5.2. I'le not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large ſo plaine a matter; but for the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. I muſt needs condemne, 1. Such as truſt in the bare name of the Church, as if therefore they ſhould be ſafe, only becauſe they can plead, The Church of God is in the Land. But it is as inſufficient a plea as that of the <hi>Jewes, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord;</hi> for the Church it ſelfe hath need of walls of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But farre greater is the ſinne of ſuch as plucke downe the walls it hath, and lay it more open to invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There are ſome falſe and treacherous men that have ill will at <hi>Sion,</hi> being of that curſed brood of <hi>Edom,</hi> they ſay, <hi>Downe with it to the ground;</hi> I meane (beſides the pleaders for <hi>Baal</hi>) ſuch as are profane and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in their lives. They ſhall ſmart for it, whoſoever they are, and ſhall at length receive the doome of Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Let us be friends to the Church, and do what wee can for the eſtabliſhing of her peace, and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of her walls. Endeavour the aſſurance of Gods love, that the love of God may bee the ſtrongeſt wall. Intreat for, and waite upon divine Providence, becauſe the Providence of God is our wall. Live anſwerable to the holy Goſpel, that the Goſpel, being continued to us, may defend us: for if that bee removed, our fence is broken downe; and for our part, by our un-anſwerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to it, wee make great breaches, ſo great, that it is our wonder, that God goeth not thorow and leaves us; that the adverſary ruſheth not in, to ruine us. Oh that at length wee were ſuitable in our lives to that holy Goſpel; that the Church might alſo have the wall of our holineſſe, which though of it ſelfe it bee but ſlight, yet, when it is of Gods building, it will hold out and give ſtrong reſiſtance to any adverſe power; nay God
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19096:88"/> himſelfe never enters as an armed man, but when there is a breach in the holineſſe of a people. Let us endeavour to be living walles; that as that <hi>Grecian</hi> City which being unwalled, the Embaſſadors of another Citie wondred, and demanded the reaſon: ſome of the chiefe Citizens poynting to the Bands of ſome able young men, Theſe (ſay they) are the walls of our Citie. So let it bee our endeavour, that we may be walls unto the Church, and to the places where we live.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Obſervat. <hi>That the Church is ſtill unfiniſhed, and wants ſome of her beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While there is building, the ſtructure is not finiſhed; no perfection till the laſt ſtone be laid. It is ſo with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, men ſtill are to be built up farther, and by the uſe of the Ordinances are edified to the moſt holy faith.

Nor is it convenient to the very condition of the Church, while it is, <hi>in Via;</hi> that it ſhould be perfect. It hath a perfect rule, ſo that it needs no traditions to be added either for ſtrength or beauty; but it is not perfectly anſwerable to that rule.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us onely make this Uſe, to pray unto God, 1. That the ſtrength &amp; the beauty of the Church might be ſtill increaſed; that the Kings Spouſe might have her clothing of wrought gold, and be brought unto the King in a raiment of needle-worke, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.13, 14. That at length the Iles, and the ſhips of Tarſhiſh might bring their Sonnes from far, their ſilver and their gold with them, unto the name of the Lord our God, and to the holy one of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that at length, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, The Sons of Strangers might build up her walls, and their Kings miniſter unto her, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 60.9, 10. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of God that hee would put freſh beauty upon his Choſen, that ſhee may multiply as the Bud of the field, and encreaſe and waxe great, and come to excellent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19096:89"/> that ſhe may be clothed with broydred work, decked with bracelets, have a jewell on her forehead, and a beautifull Crowne upon her head, that ſhe may be perfect through his comelineſſe, which hee puts upon her: according to the beauty of <hi>Judah</hi> deſcribed by God himſelfe, to the upbraiding of her ingratitude. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That her full glory may be haſtned, when the holy City the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhall be prepared as a Bride for her husband. That the building might bee raiſed to its full height; that the kingdom of Gods glory may come, which is the expectation of the Saints. Even ſo, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus.</hi> The Spirit and the Bride ſay come. This is the fourth part, What he prayed for: of the reſt in a few words.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. The fourth particular is; To whom he prayes. <hi>Doe THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> good; Build THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> Hee prayes to God, whom he knew onelyable to heare what hee ſaid, and to grant what hee knew fit. I would have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>That God is the Churches ſafety.</hi> If hee build it, it ſhall be ſtrong: if he cover it, it ſhall be ſafe: if he do good unto it, it ſhall be happy.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>That to God wee muſt have recourſe for our ſafety.</hi> They are uſuall and knowne notions, and therefore I am leſſe ſorry that I have not time to ſpeak of them: Only, let us take notice, &amp; make a due uſe of our knowledge, to ſpeed unto God, and to refuge our ſelves under the Almighty, and pray; Lord help, for it is time for thee to put to thy hand. I haſten to end with the fift and laſt part of the Text.</p>
               <p n="5">V. How, or in what manner hee prayes. <hi>Doe good in thy good pleaſure,</hi> or, in thy good Will. That which I would obſerve is this;</p>
               <p n="1">I. Obſerv. <hi>That Gods motive is himſelfe.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>ad extra,</hi> that ſets God on worke in the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his love. There is much that may move God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19096:89"/> to anger, according to our humane uſe of ſpeaking; and therefore it is ſafe to reſolve our owne perdition to our ſelves; that judgements temporall, but eſpecially eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation is <hi>becauſe</hi> man hath ſinned; yet in this we take away nothing from Gods abſoluteneſſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty; for, in his beſtowing of his love, wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all to bee free; and though heaven and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be not granted but to them that have done good in this life; yet wee may reſolve our eternall chooſing unto free pleaſure, or good pleaſure; as here: <hi>Doe good in thy good pleaſure;</hi> becauſe there could not bee found in them, what might move or draw God for to love them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Obſerv. <hi>That wee muſt uſe that motive when wee deale with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have formerly ſpoken of ſome other arguments in prayer, as the Covenant and the promiſes, but in the uſe of them, in the ultimate reſolution we bring all to <hi>good</hi> pleaſure. There muſt be an univerſall reſignation of our Choyces and deſires to God; and then we pray,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wiſely: when wee can content our ſelves with his proviſions, and ſue for what hee is delighted in, and pleaſed to give us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then wee alſo pray humbly, when pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what he is pleaſed to carve us; as wee have ſeene a wiſe and awfull mother diſpoſing to the Trenchers of her children, not what they, but what her ſelfe thinkes needfull for them; and they receiving what is laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: without finding fault, without curious appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite after another bit, or a better diſh.</p>
               <p>Let us learne thus to pray, and know at length that Art &amp; Skill that prevailes with God; Be pleaſed with what hee proportions us, and be humbly and ſubmiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content. Uſe the argument, and eſpecially neglect it not, in the behalfe of the Church: Pray <hi>Davids</hi> prayer often, <hi>Doe good to Sion in thy good pleaſure:</hi> Pray the Churches Prayer often, <hi>Ne iraſcaris Domine:</hi> Pray
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19096:90"/> often the prayer of the Prieſts &amp; Miniſters of the Lord, Be favourable, O Lord, be favourable: Spare thy people O Lord, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the heathen ſhould rule over them; Wherfore ſhould they ſay among the people, <hi>Where is their God?</hi> They are of low and unworthy thoughts that Centre themſelves in themſelves, that have no reſpect to what is abroad, that have no care of the holy Church of God; &amp; I dare bee bold in the cenſure, they are no Citizens of the new and heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that are no friends to <hi>Iſrael</hi> while it is warring in the Camps. Let us ſhew our ſelves friends in our mothers Cauſe, fight by our prayers, our ſpiritual weapons, againſt the Turke, againſt the Pope, againſt Judgments, the Peſtilence, Scarcity, &amp; the Sword. If we would have comfort to our conſciences, if audience to our ſuits in our own behalfe, let us remember <hi>Sion;</hi> for then the promiſe is, <hi>They ſhall proſper that love thee.</hi> Pray for the Kings Majeſty, pray for the ſtate of theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, pray for the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Army, pray for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, pray for the diſtreſſed in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in the <hi>Rheine,</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and in one word to comprehend theſe and all; pray for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> for our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Companions ſake let us now ſay; <hi>peace be within thy Walls, and Proſperity within thy Palaces.</hi>

               <p>The Text is part of the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> ſermon, and ſo far as I ſhall make uſe of it, wee may conſider in it;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To whom it was preached: To the <hi>Phariſees, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees</hi> and the <hi>multitude.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Rabab,</hi> to multiply. It was a mixt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of all ſorts of people, and among the reſt, there were many of the Phariſees and Sadducees. There were many Sects among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> theſe were the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and the moſt hypocriticall; yet they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the reſt to the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> which was then Gods ordinance. I meant not to ſay much of this circumſtance, but briefely would obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>That the Church viſible is mixt, there may be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, in our aſſemblies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was now the Ordinance, &amp; therefore the meeting about This, <hi>the Church:</hi> But all come; the Rabble, the multitude, and among them (whether out of curioſity or malice, or both) the Phariſees and Sadducees come likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>That the Baptiſt condemneth them for Hypocrites, that ſeemed other to the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They magnified theſe men for their eminent ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but theſe are here taxed for groſſe, though ſecret hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. There is a ſecret hypocriſie which muſt bee diſcovered ahd condemned. And if wee take a view of their appearing holineſſe, we ſhall ſee what great cauſe wee have to feare, both others and our ſelves, when we finde how farre wee come ſhort of their righteouſneſſe which we ought to have exceeded; which is all the uſe I meane to make of this circumſtance.</p>
               <p>Our view ſhall be of theſe two particulars:
<list>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:19096:91"/>
                     <item>1. What they were.</item>
                     <item>2. What they did.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We will take notice of them ſeverally, what they were.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Phariſees had holines in their name; they were ſeparated men, ſeparated from common condition, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated unto extraordinary Sanctification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were ſeparated from common condition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From Commerce and uſuall ſociety with the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar people, whom they eſteemed uncleane and curſed; as appeareth by their ſcornefull mention of them in the caſe of the Officers confeſſion: <hi>Have any of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees beleeved on him? But This People who knoweth not the Law, are curſed, John</hi> 7.48, 49.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the vulgar habit, that the difference of their very garments might witneſſe their holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the uſuall and received delights, that it might appeare their affections were weaned from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and recreations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were ſeparated unto extraordinary ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and holineſſe: and therefore the Phariſee brags in the Temple; <hi>God, I thanke thee, that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican: I faſt twice in the weeke, I give Tythes of all that I poſſeſſe, Luke</hi> 18.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were ſo preciſe, they would not eat before they waſhed, and condemne the Diſciples of Chriſt for profane deſpiſers of the ſtrict Law, that they waſhed not their hands when they eate bread, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.2. And Saint <hi>Marke</hi> gives the reaſon why they found fault; for the Phariſees, except they waſh their hands oft, eat not, <hi>Marke</hi> 7.3. They were ſo punctuall in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Tradition, that if a Phariſee came to a place where there was not enough water both to waſh and drinke, he would rather chuſe to waſh, though hee dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thirſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They would waſh when they returned from the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19096:92"/> market, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.4. leſt haply they might bee polluted by their ſociety with the profane multitude.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They waſhed their Veſſels alſo, <hi>Marke</hi> 7.4. that not their meates alone, but their very diſhes might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry holines, leſt that which entred in at the mouth, might defile the man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They would not admit familiar ſociety ſo much as to eat wiih ſinners, as may appear from that cavilling Queſtion which they made to our Saviours Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Why eateth your Maſter with Publicans and ſinners?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But to have feaſted might argue them familiar, they were therefore more preciſe, not enduring to bee touched by the ſinfull: which wee obſerve from their cenſure of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.39. <hi>This man, if hee were a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, would have knowne, who, and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for ſhe is a ſinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They made broad <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> for the oſtentation of their holineſſe. The Law was, that they ſhould make Fringes in the borders of their garments, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.38. The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Tſitſith</hi> or <hi>Zizith,</hi> which ſignifieth a locke of haire, becauſe their fringes hung like haire on their skirts; or like the branches of trees, as another word which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers uſe, <hi>Gnapaph,</hi> ſignifies. They were to wear theſe in the wings or skirts of their garments to be a Fringe, that is, a Remembrance of the commandements, But the Phariſees abuſed this unto hypocriſie and ſuperſtition, and enlarged thoſe Fringes of their garments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.5. There are two words u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Matthew,</hi> in that place; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the latter of which words is uſed by the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> which calleth them, <hi>Cruspedim.</hi> All their workes they doe for to be ſeene of men, they make broad their <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> and enlarge the <hi>Borders.</hi> To the threds of three ynches, they faſtned others, which might not be leſſe than four; and hee that had the largeſt Border was deemed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouteſt man.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:19096:92"/>7. They were much alſo in Mortification, and from their ſeverall practiſes they had ſeverall names and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. One would go careleſly, and ſometimes knock his head againſt a poſt or wall, This was called <hi>Phariſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us impingens;</hi> Another would tread ſo ſoftly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely, as if hee had not feet but ſtumps, This was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Phariſaeus truncatus;</hi> Another ſort wore an habit on their heads in the faſhion of a Mortar, which both preſſed them with the weight, and hindred their ſight, and were called <hi>Phariſaei mortarii.</hi> I might inſtance their other differences, and other their expreſſions of holineſſe, as their juſt Tythings, their liberall Almes, their two weekely Faſtings; but I haſten. Theſe were the <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Sadducees</hi> were another Sect, whom they counted very holy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were ſo ſevere in their carriage and manner of life, that ſome thinke (though it otherwiſe ſeeme to me, that they were called ſo of Sadoc the father of their ſect:) they had their name from thence, and were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of their righteouſneſſe, <hi>Tſaddichim,</hi> Righteous or Juſt men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They kept ſo cloſe to the Scriptures of <hi>Moſes,</hi> without entertaining corrupt Traditions, that they were called <hi>Karaim,</hi> Biblers or Scripturiſts; and in other obſervations ſtrict; ſome were their owne proper, in ſome like the Phariſees. Wee ſee what they were, let us ſecondly ſee,</p>
               <p n="2">2. What they did: They came from their ſeverall places, they came to the ordinance, to bee baptized; to bee baptized of <hi>John</hi> the new-Rivall of their holineſſe, and a man likely to monopolize the opinion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in that reſpect their adverſary; they came alſo with the multitude, and were content to bee ſeene in a Crowd.</p>
               <p>Such they were, and this they did: yet the Baptiſt condemneth theſe men for Hypocrites, who in all other
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19096:93"/> mens opinion were accounted very holy. How much cauſe have wee, both of feare and tryall? Let us not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that all are right that ſeeme ſo, nor our ſelves to bee ſo, unleſſe wee have good warrant upon impartiall ſearches.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Having taken a view of the Auditors, let us now attend to the ſermon itſelfe, which I told you, is partly Hortatory, partly Doctrinall: we are only to deale with the Hortatory part; The exhortation to Repentance: and becauſe <hi>Johns</hi> method is ſuch, firſt with the Arguments, and then with the propoſition. His ſcope was to affright thoſe arrogant Hypocrites, who boaſted of their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and were ſecure: and therefore in the ſeventh verſe he uſeth two arguments; One from the ſinfulneſſe of their eſtate, <hi>O generation of Vipers:</hi> The other from their unſenſibleneſſe of danger, <hi>Who hath forewarned you?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Argument. <hi>O generation of Vipers:</hi> In this he diſcovers their ſinfull condition, that they were the wicked off-ſpring of wicked parents, and enemies of the Truth &amp; the Prophets. I will paſſe this more briefly with three Obſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Obſervation. <hi>That Hypocrites are a generation of Vipers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Phariſees had not onely <hi>Ortum Viperinum,</hi> but they kept <hi>Naturam Viperarum.</hi> Such they were, and naturally all are ſuch; For, 1. the Viper is full of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome: ſo malice and wickedneſſe doth abound in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. The Vipers eat thorow the bellies of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: there is that enmity againſt truth, but it is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true of the Phariſaicall, the perſecuters of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the true Church. 3. Vipers are ſpecious in ſhew, and as it were painted in their skinnes: Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie masketh it ſelfe, but with a Vizzard fairer than its native proportion. 4. The teeth of Vipers are hid within their gummes, but when they cloſe them they preſſe forth poyſon: ſuch is the diſſembled yet dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19096:93"/> malice of the wicked. 5. The Vipers when they have bitten a man, haſten to the waters; the fitteſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of the reſt to hypocriſie, but chiefly appliable to the Phariſees, who had their <hi>Baptiſmata,</hi> their frequent Waſhings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of this may be double to us:</p>
               <p n="1">1. For our deep humiliation, when wee take notice what naturally we are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For our ſerious tryall, that we would examine our ſelves whether we ſtill be ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Obſerv. <hi>That the conſideration of this condition is a motive to Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men are therefore more ſlacke to repent, becauſe they know not ſinne, and the nature of ſin: they ſee not how odious, how poyſonous, how miſerable they are, and therefore being not ſicke, have no care to ſeek a Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; but if we were truely acquainted with our ſelves, how much we are diſeaſed, it would be a ſtrong motive to repent, that we might be healed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us be much in this meditation, and often caſt our ſelves upon thoſe thoughts and obſervations, that wee may be truely, kindly, ſeaſonably humbled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Baptiſt diſcovers this conſideration, to that end, that he might move them to repentance.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems too bitter an application; it might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exaſperate than amend: nay, there was much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> zeale; ſome muſt bee ſo handled: therefore our Saviour alſo deals roughly with this kind of men; Serpents, generations of Vipers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.33. A thorne fetches blood when t'is rudely handled, but a nettle ſtings moſt, unleſſe we preſſe it hard: Theſe were nettles, and were ſelfe conceited of their holineſſe, and proudly domineered; therefore he is not more conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable than wiſe, in that application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It is ſometimes ſit to ſpeak rough words, when the hearers conſcience is not tender. Wee muſt learne that wiſedome, both to obſerve and apply, when wee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19096:94"/> meet with a Phariſee or Sadducee, to deale as <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt did, plainly and to the Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Argument is from their unſenſiblenes of danger, which I moſt intended to ſpend this time upon; in the latter words of the ſeventh Verſe: <hi>Who hath warned you to fly from the wrath to come?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not the ſame ſenſe of theſe words among all Expoſitors;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke them an Admiration: What new thing is this! What ſtrange ſudden change! that I ſee Phariſees comming to my Baptiſme! Who hath war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some think it a doubtfull expreſſion, mixed of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and ſuſpicion. Are yee likewiſe come to my Bagtiſme? whether are ye ſincere? whether are yee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? Who hath warned you?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some think it a voice of Terrour: Doe ye think to eſcape, becauſe ye come now to my Baptiſme? Who hath warned you? Who hath directed you in this courſe? Yee cannot bee able to flye from the wrath to come.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But leaving theſe to the approbation of ſuch as like them; I rather conceive it to be a voice of denyall: Who hath warned you? That is, None hath warned you; or, you are not warned. You come to my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme formally, hypocritically; but you continue Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and apprehend not the danger ye are in, nor how yee may eſcape it; ye are not ſenſible of flying from the wrath to come. There is a little difficulty in the reading of the words: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There is a double ellipſis, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and the other this: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; as the word is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But the ſenſe I have given; hee exhorts them to repent by conſideration of that wrath which they were not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to fly from. And according to this interpretation, the obſervations I would take out for your uſe, are theſe foure.</p>

               <p n="1">I. Obſerv. <hi>That there is wrath to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By wrath in this place we underſtand the judgement of God offended and wrathfull, and the effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by divine wrath is manifeſted; ſo the word is uſed to ſignifie in many Scriptures. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Thou treaſureſt up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of God. Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The Wrath of God comes on the children of diſobedience.</hi> But how wrath may be ſaid to bee in God, ſeeing in God is no paſſion, will bee worthy of explication. Wee may conclude this firſt rule, That God is more diſpleaſed with ſinne than man is or can be. He cannot endure it, as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold evill, and canſt not looke on iniquity, Hab.</hi> 1.13. Yet this ſecond rule is as true, That there is no paſſion in God. Wee muſt therefore finde wrath to bee in God in another manner than it is in man: in him only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſimilitude of effect; ſo the Schoole diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth of <hi>Ira afficiens,</hi> and <hi>efficiens:</hi> In man is <hi>ira affici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> we are changed and perturbed with our indignation; but in God is <hi>ira efficiens,</hi> hee doth the ſame as wee, but without changes, without perturbation: So the Lunary Rain-bow is not affected with colours as the Solar is. There is a concluſion in ſome Schoolemen, That no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or operation that eſſentially includes imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can properly be attributed to God; but if the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection be accidentall, and therefore ſeparable, it may: ſo that when the imperfection is ſevered from it, it may be ſaid to bee in God. Now a paſſion may two waies be ſaid to be evill: 1. From the very kind of it, when the object imports it evill: ſo envie is; and therefore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19096:95"/> envie cannot bee found in perfection it ſelfe. 2. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quantity of it, when it is too much, or too little; ſo anger may be evill, and ſo not in God: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that evill is accidentall, and anger may bee ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either from defect or exceſſe; as it is ſo ſevered, it may be ſaid of God, and that either primarily or ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily: 1. Primarily, The wrath of God is no more than <hi>voluntas puniendi,</hi> Gods will to puniſh. 2. Secondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, it is the puniſhment it ſelfe; ſo that now wee finde, both, 1. Wrath in God, 2. Wrath from God. Both which are joyned by the Prophet, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Do they provoke mee to Anger, ſaith the Lord? Doe they not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke themſelves, to the confuſion of their owne faces?</hi> Yet God ſtill remaines the ſame, without alteration, as that acute and ſubtle Docter <hi>Jackson</hi> after his large mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall demonſtration of his <hi>hologónie,</hi> the circular figure, hath very divinely expreſſed it: Hee is moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet never moved with love, becauſe hee is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally wholly love: He is moſt jealous of his glory, and a revenger of iniquity moſt ſevere, yet never moved with jealouſie, yet never paſſionate in revenge, becauſe to ſuch as provoke his punitive juſtice, he is eternally ſeverity, and Revenge it ſelfe. To apply the explication to the mind of the place; Saint <hi>John</hi> means the declaration of Gods wrath, not preſent, but future; and may note, both the deſtruction of their City, and more principally, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, which is elſewhere plainely called, <hi>Wrath to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. So that when we ſay, There is wrath to come, wee underſtand, that God may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and may have a ſtore both of temporall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and eternall, which may fall upon us.</p>
               <p>Having thus cleared it, let us ſee it proved. That there is wrath to come, it appeares,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the very <hi>beeing of ſinne,</hi> for there is a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe in ſinne unto judgement. You know there will be a Storme when the Vapours are exhaled, and Clouds have been long gathering. Sinne is the ſeed of wrath, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19096:95"/> judgement is then ſowen, when ſinne is committed, therefore, though the ſeed may for a while lye covered in the ground, yet the Harveſt will come at length, and when the ſinner is ripned, he is cut downe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appeares from Gods truth, for God hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wrath, and Gods threatnings are not in vaine. There was a ſevere doome againſt <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and the threat had Truth in it, and therefore, though the painted Strumpet frolickt away her time, as not expecting it, yet at the ſet time, the wrath came; as <hi>Jehu</hi> the conquerour made the obſervation of it when his ſervants returned in with the news, that the dogs had eaten her: This is the word of the Lord, which hee ſpake by <hi>Elijah</hi> the Tiſhbite, <hi>In the portion of Jezreel, dogs ſhall eate the fleſh of Jezabel,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.36. There are threatnings of wrath every where in Scripture ſcattered againſt ſin, and ſhall come to paſſe becauſe God is true.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is wrath to come, appeares from Gods equity, for men are not ever puniſhed here, or not for the preſent, therefore there muſt bee a time of account and retribution. We ſee oft that wicked men, that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters live pleaſurably, and dye unplagued, but the equall juſtice of God will not ſuffer them to eſcape ſcot-free, therfore where there is not a preſent rod, there muſt be future wrath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, it is evident from Gods glory, for hee is not onely juſt, but will have the glory of his juſtice, and will manifeſt his equitie. Wee wonder at Gods dealing for the preſent, therefore there muſt bee a time of ſeparating. Haply our ſteps may wel-nigh ſlip, and wee may bee envious at the fooliſh, when wee ſee the proſperity of the wicked; and may bee ready fooliſhly to queſtion and repine; How doth God know? Is there knowledge in the moſt high? Behold, theſe are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly who proſper in the world, who encreaſe in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But let us goe into the Sanctuary of God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their end, then we ſhall find them ſet in ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19096:96"/> places, brought into deſolation as in a moment, and utterly conſumed with terrors: for God will at length bee glorified in the equity of his proceedings, and in mens notice of that equity.</p>
               <p>This may be uſefull to us in a double notion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. It removes the ground of our unwarrantable admiration and exclaiming of the ordering of time and government. Men are ready to diſpute, as <hi>Pompey</hi> did in the Gardens of <hi>Chryſippus</hi> after the loſſe at <hi>Pharſalia, Whether there be a Providence.</hi> When we ſee men thrive by injuſtice, and proſper in their evill courſes; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that feare God, and live holily make themſelves a prey; we wonder that God endures thoſe, and forgets theſe: but ceaſe to wonder, for, <hi>there is wrath to come.</hi> Some buſie ſervants that would be wiſer than their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, may forwardly deſire and urge it; <hi>Maſter, there are Tares, wilt thou that wee goe and gather them up?</hi> But what is the anſwer? <hi>Nay: leſt while yee gather up the Tares, yee root up alſo the Wheat with them, let both grow together untill the Harveſt, and in the time of the Harveſt, I will ſay to the Reapers, gather ye together firſt the Tares, and binde them in bundles to burne them, Matth.</hi> 13.28, 29, 30. Fret not, but wayte upon Gods time. It was the madneſſe of the Anabaptiſts of <hi>Munſter,</hi> that they would purge the world in a frantick fit, and put to the ſword, all the wicked upon earth; but Gods wiſdome and method is otherwiſe, hee will not at all acquit, but hee defers the execution to a fitter day, and then wrath will come; the Tares ſhall bee bound in bundles for the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Let us beleeve this truth, that there is wrath to come: the not beleeving of this, is cauſe of much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſſe, of much profaneneſſe, of much carnall ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our lives. But if we did truly beleeve it, it would beget a profitable feare; which I would alſo exhort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, a feare of temporall judgements, a feare alſo of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:19096:96"/>1. Let us feare the wrath of temporall judgements which are threatned and ſent of God, that men might feare before him. When ſtormes are preparing there is cauſe to feare, and I ſee not any reaſon but that they which have ſon-like affections ſhould yet tremble. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when wee apprehend how terrible God is in his wrath here, we ſhall ſee cauſe of feare. Look upon examples of his wrath, how the Lord lookt when hee frowned. When the Inhabitans of the old world had polluted their waies, God was diſpleaſed, and wrecks his diſpleaſure upon them with a fearefull tempeſt, the depths were broken up, and the windowes of heaven opened, and all creatures living (beſides <hi>Noah's</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) were ſwallowed of the waters. The cry of Sodoms ſinne reacht up unto heaven, &amp; pierced the eares of God, and moved him to ſuch indignation, that hee conſumes them with an intermingled ſhower of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and beats downe the Inhabitants together with their habitations, Sodom and the adjoyning Cities. We judge of the rage and fury of a tempeſt that is paſt, by the Ship-wrack that is made, when we ſee the floating car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes of drowned men, the broken ribs of the torn veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, the forſaken goods here &amp; there ſcattered upon the ſands; ſo hath God been pleaſed to let us ſee the fury of his wrath, in the ſtroaks that have bin laid thick &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie upon former offenders. When the people had danced about their calfe, the Lord ſpeakes, as impatient of the delay of his revenge; <hi>Let mee alone, that my wrath may wexe hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them:</hi> As if he boyled in the heat of his rage, &amp; would not be quiet till they had felt what it was to offend their God. At another time, when the people complained, the Lord was diſpleaſed, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and conſumed them, or, did eat among them, as the Hebrew bears it, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.1. God did devoure them in his anger, and as wee ſhall ſee after a great fire which hath conſumed a building, ſome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19096:97"/> rubbiſh, and here and there ſome pieces of timber halfe conſumed to aſhes, and made blacke with the flame, as remaining monuments of that cruell and mercileſſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement; ſo the wrath of God brought ſuch deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a monument of it was left in the name of the place, ver. 3. it was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which comes of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> He burnt: to ſignifie to us an example of ſevere revenge upon the provocation of almighty God. Obſerve how <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets it forth in his caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.26. <hi>The Lord was wroth with mee for your ſakes, and would not heare mee; but ſaid, let it ſuffice thee, ſpeake no more unto mee of this matter.</hi> It is not a ſmall matter to have God offended; <hi>Moſes</hi> had that priviledge to ſpeake to the Almighty face to face; wee would have thought if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould prefer a ſuite, hee might bee ſure to ſpeed; but wee ſee, God ſpeakes to <hi>Moſes</hi> as if hee did not know him, but will not grant his requeſt for entring Canaan; <hi>let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> ſpeake no more. If we reade in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.21, 22, 23. how <hi>Moſes</hi> works upon it, how he aggravates the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt himſelfe, wee cannot but deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what a thing it is, to bee ſenſible that God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with us. The ſword, or ſcarcity, or peſtilence, are terrible things in themſelves; but oh let us appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what it were to have one of theſe, or a farre more light and eaſie judgement ſent among us in anger. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) rebuke mee not in thine anger, neither chasten me in in thy hot diſpleaſure, Pſal.</hi> 6.1. Hee ſeems more to feare the wrath than the judgement: If I bee rebuked, if chaſtned, yet oh let it not bee in diſpleaſure; That I may bee able to beare, This I cannot. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> prayes in that manner, and with reaſon: <hi>O Lord, correct me not in thine anger, leſt thou bring me to nothing, Jerem.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Let us feare before God, for his wrath will cruſh us, it will cruſh us to nothing, it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us feare alſo the wrath of eternall judgement; That is, truely, properly the wrath to come. In other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19096:97"/> judgements, Gods anger is kindled, in this, his jealouſie ſmokes. Other plagues lye heavie upon the backes of Sinners, this, a far heavier burthen will grind them unto duſt. When God drinkes to men in puniſhments, hee makes them pledge him in a bitter cup; but this is the dregs of the cup of his fury &amp; indignation. But we may ſooner ſpend a multitude of words, than be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it fully; and therefore Saint <hi>Jude</hi> rather leaves it to conceit, than hee will deſcribe it, when hee calls it, <hi>The Blackneſſe of Darkneſſe for ever.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> hath a conceited gloſſe upon thoſe words which <hi>David</hi> uſeth to the men of Jabeſh Gilead, for their ſincere kindneſſe to their dead Maſter, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Lord ſhew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and truth unto you: Miſericordiam in praeſenti, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem in futuro:</hi> as if the mercy which is ſhewed here, were but as nothing, but a lye in reſpect of that reall truth of mercy which ſhall bee ſhewed hereafter. So the wrath that is here manifeſted in temporall infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, is but a ſhadow compared with that truth of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which wicked men ſhall feele in hell. Some books have deſcribed that condition; I'le not fall upon their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but would only deſire to leave your ſeparated and retired thoughts ſometimes upon that meditation, that you would beleeve there is a wrath to come; that ſo a profitable kindly feare might be maintained.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond obſervation. <hi>That the wrath to come may be fled from.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That wrath may be avoyded, needs no other proofe than that it hath beene; and that proofe, the hiſtory of Scripture frequently yeelds us. <hi>Ahab</hi> was a wicked man, yet I cannot thinke but his humiliation was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, who was ſo ſenſible of the threatned wrath, that hee rent his clothes, put ſack-cloth on his fleſh, faſted, lay in ſack-cloth, went ſoftly; however, God accepted it, and tells the Prophet: <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelfe before mee? Beoauſe he humbleth himſelfe, I will not bring the evill in his dayes,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21, 29. The King
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19096:98"/> of Ninive found eſcape by the ſame way; God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evill way, and God repented of the evill that hee ſaid hee would doe unto them, and did it not, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.10. Whether theſe were ſincere in what they did, comes not to our preſent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; it is enough that wrath was fled from: but in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> we have an inſtance without that exception, in the return of an anſwer from <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſſe; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold I will bring evill upon this place; but becauſe thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thy ſelfe before God, behold I will gather thee to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and thou ſhalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall thy eyes ſee all the evill which I will bring upon this place,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 34.24, 27.28. But beſides examples, it may appear upon this ground of reaſon. Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may bee avoyded, and therefore wrath, therefore judgement: ſuch as know how to hide themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt, are refuged: <hi>for there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and therefore being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his blood we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. for <hi>Hee is that Jeſus which delivered us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. But I need not prove further what is not at all doubted, and therfore may proceed to make it uſefull by application.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. That wrath may be fled from, concludes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, That the eſcape of wrath is by flight; our ſafety is not by ſtanding out, but in running from the ſtorme; which I rather note to diſcover their folly who ſeeke other means of prevention or eſcape: as namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as ſtand unto their cauſe, and urge their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency againſt the righteous ſentence of an unpartiall Judge; as if they were ſo guiltleſſe, that evill could not come nigh them; or if it did, they might complaine of wrong, rather than beg a redreſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as upon the ſame opinion, in ſtead of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves guilty, traverſe the Indictment (to uſe the phraſe of our law), and do make contradiction to it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:19096:98"/>3. Such as think the execution of the ſentence may be ſtayed and a reprivall had, by corrupting the ſeate of Judicature, by bribing of the Judge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as truſt to their pleadings, that they have claime of priviledge and immunity to their perſons.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Or Laſtly, that deceive themſelves in their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from others. But all theſe are deceitfull refuges; Wee are every one guilty, and cannot overthrow the Bill, the righteous Judge will not bee bribed, wee have no plea of exemption, and all humane ſtrength will faile us; There is no avoidance but by flying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Let us therefore wiſely uſe the right remedy, let us fly. But here is ſtill the difficulty, how wee may fly from wrath. There is a double flight: <list>
                     <item>1. Corporall.</item>
                     <item>2. Spirituall.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Corporal flight is that which ſome hope they may ſafely truſt unto. The Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, hid themſelves in the dens, and the Rocks of the mountaines, and ſaid to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the wrath of the Lambe, for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand? <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. That ſhall bee the ſudden and miſerable ſhift which poore wretched men ſhall make at that great day. So others think to ſcape from judgements temporall and preſent: but in vaine; for every place is in Gods reach, as the Pſalmiſt hath fully and excellently expreſſed it, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. God beſets us behind and before, and layes his hand upon us; and therefore whither ſhall wee fly from his preſence? Every place is Gods Gaole, and every creature is his Gaoler, hee hath his Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ready, and can ſerve them when hee pleaſeth; ſo the Lord threatneth, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.19. As if a man did flee from a Lion and a Beare met him. If God meane to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us, though we eſcape one judgement, another ſhall overtake us; they are all Gods Officers, and are ready
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19096:99"/> upon their ſervice, ſo that wee ſhall bee ſure to fall into the hands of ſome of them. It was a grave ſpeech of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: If one man ſinne againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him:</hi> there ſhall bee a legall proceeding, and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhall finde an Advocate to plead his cauſe in open Court; <hi>but if a man ſinne against the Lord, who ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for him?</hi> Hee muſt needs bee caſt, for who will be an Advocate to defend a cauſe againſt God? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. The Lord cannot bee prevented of his purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man, for, as it is very aptly expreſſed in the <hi>Pſalme, Pſa.</hi> 11.6. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the wicked hee ſhall raine ſnares.</hi> There are ſnares laid, and men that are Gods enemies will bee entrapt and taken; and here is the difference: The ſnares which men lay may bee avoyded; if there bee ſnares in one place, they may goe ſafe in another: but God in every place will take us, his ſnares are as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as the drops of raine; you know the raine falleth upon every part, ſo that no piece is dry: ſo are Gods engines: he raines ſnares, and can meet with us, in our ſelves, in our bodies, in our mindes, in our children, in our friends, in our eſtates, or in our names: hee hath a thouſand waies to deale with us, therefore wee cannot eſcape by a corporall flight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirituall flight, is a flying from Gods wrath, unto God, under his owne wings. We muſt doe as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> did to eſcape the violence of the Flood, enter into the Arke, bee hid in that place, and by that way that God hath appointed, bee found in Chriſt, covered with his garment, ſigned as one of his. There was a great deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Aegypt, the firſt borne of every family ſlaine, how ſhall the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eſcape? they muſt ſprinkle the doore-poſts of their houſes with the blood of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall; and the deſtroying Angel ſeeing it, would paſſe by. Wee muſt bee ſprinkled, ſealed as Gods peculiars, and then wee ſhall eſcape. But more particularly, wee muſt flee from Gods wrath, by ſhunning what procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his wrath, which rule we ſhall beſt finde by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19096:99"/> three particulars which are ſignified by this word, <hi>Wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Wrath</hi> ſignifies, Gods being offended, therefore wee muſt carefully ſhunne what ever provokes him to anger. The ground of indignation is ſome injury done to one which ſome way concernes him; it is not a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple injury; for no man will be angry, that a <hi>Jew</hi> is chaind at Conſtantinople, or that a <hi>Moore</hi> is whipt at Venice, becauſe, though haply the correction may be injurious, yet it nothing concernes us whether it be or no. That which moves indignation muſt be ſomewhat that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth upon God, but moſt properly that which tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth or trencheth upon his reputation and honour; we muſt therefore finde what diſhonours God, and labour to avoid it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The neglect of a due in point of honour, moves a generous mind to indignation: as <hi>Alexander</hi> did much ſtomack it, when <hi>Darius</hi> omitted the title of King unto him. We may not neglect to give unto God what hee challengeth from us as his owne due and right, the honour of his name upon all occaſions, and in every bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It eaſily incenſeth us, when beſides the neglect of honouring us, ſomewhat is done to us, that diminiſheth our reputation. As when the Empreſſe of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had let ſlip ſome words of contempt againſt that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Narſes,</hi> that ſhee would make him ſpin among her maidens: They ſo enraged the injured Captaine, that he proteſted in his anger, hee would weave ſuch a webbe as all their power ſhould not undoe; and thereupon, in a deepe revenge brought the <hi>Lombards</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi> The generous, of all other injuries, can leaſt beare diſgraces. If we ſpeake contemptibly of Gods power, if underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luingly of his wiſdome, if complainingly, of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, if murmuringly of his providence, if impatiently of his corrections, we do what we can to diſgrace him, and God will be highly provoked.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:19096:100"/>3. Indignation is moved, when the injury is done by ſuch perſons, as are either below us for their condition, or beholding to us for ſome benefit: though wee could brooke an injury from a great One, and a Stranger, yet we could never endure it from a ſervant, engaged as wel by courteſies received, as the debt of ſubjection. We ſtand in both thoſe relations unto God, in regard of our condition, infinitely below him, viler than the very duſt; and in regard of our engagements, bound by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercies: for whatever wee either are or have, is wholly of him, therefore for us to provoke him, muſt needs make his wrath waxe hot againſt us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another ground of indignation or anger, is, when the injury is done before ſuch perſons, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such with whom wee contend for glory: to give an affront unto a competitor in the preſence of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, as to diſgrace <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Pompey,</hi> muſt needs raiſe him unto wrath and indignation. God doth as it were contend with the world, with gaine, with pleaſure, for glory; ſo that to prefer the world or our owne luſts before God, is to diſhonour him, and moves him to wrath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such whom we love: (to cleare a divine matter by an amorous) if an affront bee done unto a lover in the preſence of his Miſtreſſe (as affection is wont to call the party upon whom affection is beſtowed) it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more grievous, becauſe in her preſence to whom hee would endeare himſelfe. God wooeth the ſoule, and is jealous of our love, leſt it bee given to another. Gaine and pleaſure are likewiſe Suiters, if we prefer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our profit or delight before Gods will, hee muſt needs be offended with us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such by whom wee would bee reverenced: ſo to diſgrace a Maſter in the ſight of his ſervants, or a Father before his children, doth aggravate the injury, becauſe it maketh them contemned where they looke for a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reſpect. Wee ſtand in ſuch relation to God, as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19096:100"/> to our great Maſter, as children to our heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore to offend him as wee ſo relate unto him, cannot but occaſion his heavie diſpleaſure: for, if he be a Father, hee muſt have his honour, if hee bee a Maſter, he muſt have his feare, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. That is the firſt thing we are to doe, to flee from wrath, We muſt ſhun what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wrath ſignifieth Gods being offended as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in ſome judgement: therefore in this ſenſe, wee are to find out the examples of ſinnes and puniſhments where wrath hath been manifeſted, and avoyde them. The Scripture is plentifull, I will only inſtance a few, &amp; leave others to your owne obſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Profaneneſſe: when the inhabitants of the old world gave themſelves over to their owne pleaſures; buying and ſelling, eating and drinking, marrying, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in marriage, but had no care of Gods ſervice, then wrath came with a flood. We muſt take heed of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane worldly ſecure courſe of living, minding onely the earth, and plodding after it, for this deadens the life of grace; and the neglect of due worſhip to God, incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Envie: wee have this inſtanced, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.2. In <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> who envied <hi>Moſes; What,</hi> ſay they, <hi>hath God ſpoken only by Moſes? Hath hee not ſpoken alſo by us?</hi> Whereupon it followeth in the ninth verſe, <hi>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them.</hi> They were troubled that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be the only Man, only deare in the eſteeme of the people; ſuch are the ſecret thoughts of the envious againſt the eminent, but the Lord endures not ſuch burnings, ſuch ſtrifes; he would have us quietly poſſeſſe our ſelves, contented with the condition in which we are placed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Selfe-ſeeking: <hi>Balaam</hi> is the example of this; <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak</hi> ſends for him, God would not have him goe; <hi>Balak</hi> profers largely, <hi>Balaam</hi> ſoliciteth for liberty; it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but, ſaith the Text, Gods anger was kindled becauſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19096:101"/> he went, <hi>Num.</hi> 22.22. <hi>Balaam</hi> was a ſelfe-ſeeker, &amp; had a covetous itch after the Kings favour and reward; this makes him earneſt to goe, though hee knew the will of God contrary. If wee hunt after our owne gaine, wee ſhall offend God, &amp; muſt therefore learne ſelfe-denyall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Rebellion, aggravated with ingratitude: Here <hi>Salomon</hi> is the monument, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.9. The Lord was angry with <hi>Salomon,</hi> becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, who had appeared unto him twice. If God afford unto us frequent viſits, the tokens of his familiar acquaintance to us, if then we forget him, and our hearts turne away from him, we may deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look for wrath.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Siding with Gods enemies: This we find in the caſe of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2. Shouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord. God will not endure to have us take part with his enemies, for then we breake the league; and the breach of league ſhall ſurely be puniſhed. I might follow this with more exemplary puniſhed ſins, but I rather leave it to your owne private readings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wrath ſignifieth eternall damnation: therefore to avoyd that, we muſt avoyd infidelity and ſtubbornneſſe againſt the offer of grace. If an invitation bee made, and wee refuſe to come to the Supper of the King, hee will wexe wroth againſt us, and deſtroy us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.7. Let us lay hold upon Chriſt, upon the offer of free mercy in the Goſpel; Let us <hi>kiſſe the Son leſt he be angry, and ſo we periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled, yea but a little.</hi> Let us refuge our ſelves under <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from the wrath to come. This is the ſpirituall flight that we muſt take, if ever we hope to eſcape from wrath, for otherwiſe, Suits, or Bayles, or Protections, will not ſtead us. So much of the ſecond, that wrath may be fled from.</p>
               <p>Upon the other two obſervations I muſt beſtow but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19096:101"/> a ſmall time and a few words.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third Obſervation: <hi>That wicked men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible both of the wrath to come, and of flying from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath forewarned you?</hi> That is, you are not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned. The Divell is very malicious, and hood-winks us for a double inconvenience, that he might make us to be venturous upon ſin, and ſecure without feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It diſcovereth to us the reaſon why men live ſo ſecurely as if they expected not a ſentence, and ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of the ordinance; they apprehend not the weight of ſin, nor ſee what follows. But to conclude.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The fourth and laſt obſervation is this; <hi>That to be ſenſible of both theſe, of wrath and the remedy, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Baptiſt wiſely uſeth and diſpoſeth it: That he might preſſe them to the duty of the next verſe, hee labours to convince them of their danger, and how it might be eſcaped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us labour to bee ſenſible of both theſe; of both or neither: for if we ſee wrath without eſcape, we ſhall be ſwallowed of deſpaire; if we ſee eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrath, wee ſhall bee deceived with preſumption. Let us ſee both, apprehend both in their true naturall force.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us be ſenſible of wrath, ſee ſin alive. We are not ſtartled with the apprehenſion of ſin, becauſe we ſee it not as it is, alive, and ready to devoure us. You know or conceive in your minds, that a Lyon, or a Beare, or a Dragon, are terrible beaſts; but if you ſhould ſee a Lyon or a Beare painted on a wall, they would not affright you, though the Painter ſhould beſtow his beſt Art in laying the colours to make them look never ſo terribly; they would not fright you, becauſe you know they are but painted. Wee looke upon ſin as a dead thing, onely painted out by the oratory of witty Preachers, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not at all troubled. But if you ſhould meet a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19096:102"/> living Beare in ſome open place, gaping, &amp; ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure, it would amaze you: let us labour to ſee the life of ſin, the danger of it, the gaping mouth of it, &amp; then it will make us run for ſafety by repentance; there is one work to ſee ſin alive, but that is not enough.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us bee ſenſible of the remedy: ſee mercy alive alſo, that the wrath may be eſcaped; for unleſſe we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this alſo, wee ſhall ſooner deſpaire than repent. A man muſt firſt ſee the gaping Beaſt before he runneth and ſeeketh a place of ſuccour. But if one ſhould ſee ſuch a Beaſt in a plaine open field, where there were neither houſe nor hedge to hide, he would have no mind to run, but grow deſperate or fall down with amazement and feare; but if there bee an houſe neere, and the doore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, it gives incouragement to run. Upon the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinne and wrath, we muſt ſee mercy neer, and the doore open for us to enter, elſe we ſhall bee fo far from repentance, which is a turning to God, that we ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turne from him with deſpaire and horror. Let us ſee ſinne alive, and mercy alive alſo; both wrath and the remedy of wrath, and then we are fitted to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, A turning to the better. The Latin word <hi>Poenitentia,</hi> which is of <hi>poena,</hi> puniſhment, as agreeing rather with ſorrow onely than converſion; doth not ſo properly expreſſe what wee have in hand, as <hi>Reſipiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> The word is not uſed in ancient Latin writers, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once found in <hi>Cicero,</hi> when hee ſpeakes of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> how paſſionate he was after hee had killed <hi>Clitus, Tanta fuit vis poenitendi.</hi> Yet I ſhould not be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in rejecting that word, or taking the other; partly, becauſe I find it uſed by old Chriſtian Latins, as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian;</hi> partly and ſpecially, becauſe I conceive more in repentance than a bare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of errour, or turning unto God; That
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19096:104"/> there is beſides, an afflicting or grieving of the ſoule, and a deteſtation of ſin; which manifeſts it ſelfe by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes, As <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. <hi>I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> And, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Turne unto mee in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, weeping and mourning.</hi> There the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, yet is not without externall ſignes of ſorrow and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So St. Auſtin in one Epiſtle uſeth it, <hi>Eſt poenitentia bonorum &amp; fidelium poena quotidiana, in qua pectora tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus dicentes, Dimitte nobis debita noſtra.</hi> And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place; <hi>Certam poenitentiam non facit niſi odium pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati, &amp; Amor Dei, quando ſic poenites, ut tibi amarum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat in animo quod antè dulce fuit in vita, &amp; quod te pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us oblectabat in corpore, ipſum te cruciat in mente.</hi> The name then gives all this unto us, that it is an after-wit, ſorrowing for ſin, turning from it with deteſtation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it is not enough to looke upon the garment, but we muſt know the thing itſelfe; which falls under divers acceptations: and becauſe Preachers according to the ambiguous ſenſe of it, uſe it ſometimes one way, ſometimes another, that the unacquainted here is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by rhe ambiguity, &amp; knoweth not how to take it; That I may direct you to a profitable hearing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this point; I will tell you the differences, and how repentance is taken,
<list>
                     <item>1. Leſſe properly.</item>
                     <item>2. More properly.</item>
                     <item>3. Improperly.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Leſſe properly, Repentance is two wayes ſpoken of, and underſtood.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> and then it is no more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a diſpleaſing, or wounding of the ſoule; which is, either Legall, and that may bee found in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates; or Evangelicall, which is only in converts, and is called a ſorrow unto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Generally,</hi> and that is more than Contrition, in a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19096:104"/> generall notion; it is the whole turning of a man to God. Which difference ſerves ſomewhat to the cleering of that controverted queſtion, Which is firſt, Faith or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? If wee take Repentance <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> then Repentance is before Faith: If <hi>Generally,</hi> then Faith is before Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. More properly: and then repentance is upon the ſight and deteſtation of ſinne, the true converſion of the life unto God. This the Scripture calls, The renewing of the ſoule; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind. Ezekiel</hi> ſpeakes of it, and more than the Apoſtle: <hi>Repent, and turne your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions, make you a new heart and a new ſpirit. Ezek.</hi> 18.30, 31. Which agreeth with thoſe other places which make two parts, Mortification and Vivification; a dying with Chriſt, and a riſing to newneſſe of life: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from evill, and doing good; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.14. A cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to doe evill, and learning to doe well, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.16, 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Improperly; and ſo the outward profeſſion is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led repentance; and this is beſt expreſſed by the word <hi>Poenitentia,</hi> penitence, or penance. This is ordinary, or extraordinary; and both, either of one alone, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to many; the common to many is a publike mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of ſorrow, deteſtation, and converſion, by ſome humiliation; and ſo theſe aſſemblies of ours, and ſuch of the like nature, have beene called, and not improperly, by ſome of the Ancients, <hi>Penances.</hi> But what repentance is, properly, I told you in the ſecond diviſion. So wee have cleered the firſt thing, what repentance is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, What are fruits. The word <hi>fructus,</hi> may either be derived, <hi>à ferendo,</hi> becauſe of bearing or bringing forth; or <hi>à fruendo,</hi> of enjoying, becauſe fruit is the pleaſure or riches of any thing that beares: and being the vertue of every thing in its kind, it hath a kind of deliciouſneſſe in it, as the Gr. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſeemeth to bee of the Chald. <hi>carpe,</hi> ſweet ripe fruit. But that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation which I am moſt pleaſed in, is, that a fruitfull
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19096:105"/> man is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Birth, of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to beare; ſo that fruit is that which a living thing ſends out of it. That which hath life in it, ſendeth forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what: you may ſee it in Animals, they procreate; you may ſee it in plants, if a ſtock be dead, it ſo remaines, but if there be life in it, it ſhoots out branches, buds, leaves; ſomewhat it ſends forth of it ſelfe. The fruit of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal is the worke of that life; ſo the fruit of the plant is the worke of the plant: and therefore the Apoſtle hath cleared this phraſe by another, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.20. <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the Gentiles, that they might doe workes meet for repentance. The fruits are the workes of that repentance which hath life within it: which may ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for the cleering of that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is, What are meet fruits, or fruits meet for repentance. This may admit of a double interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our fruits or works muſt be meet for repentance, that is, there muſt be ſomewhat in the degree of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſuitable to the degree of our ſins. I know it is true, that there is nothing but Chriſts death which is infinitely meritorious, which is proportionable to the ſinne: yet the acts of our repentance muſt ſuite with the acts of our ſin. This wee finde in the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> He ſinned greatly, and hee wept bitterly: hee ſinned, and hee wept; but there is a farther proportion, hee ſinned greatly, and hee wept bitterly. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Perſecuter, but when hee was converted, hee became a Preacher; there is a proportion; but <hi>Paul</hi> who was a bloody Perſecuter, became a moſt painfull Preacher: there's a farther meetneſſe. Wee muſt thus be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in our penitence, to our ſinne; when we have ſlipt from God, wee muſt catch a faſter hold upon him; and by ſo much faſter as our ſlip was fouler.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But ſecondly, which is the ſenſe I would rather give you; there muſt bee anſwerableneſſe in our works to the truth of our repentance; our works muſt corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19096:105"/> to the life which is within us; when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, there muſt be works meet.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To Synecdochicall repentance; true ſorrow, and thoſe notes which are given fully by the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To generall repentance; hatred of ſin, purpoſe to leave ſin, reformation of the life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To proper repentance; Converſion, a new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life, and ſuch actions as flow from new life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To improper repentance; profeſsion by ſignes: they are theſe; contrition, confeſſion, and ſatisfaction. Theſe are all fraits worthy of, or meet for repentance; and it ſhall ſuffice for rhe firſt buſineſſe which I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, The explication.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The confirmation of this truth, that there are ſuch fruits, appears:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God hath commanded them: if there were not ſuch a thing <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> there ſhould be no precept; for though wee are ſometimes commanded to doe what wee cannot doe, yet wee are never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe what never was to be done: if God bid us be perfect, therefore there is perfection, though we cannot be perfect. But this is required both here, and <hi>Act.</hi> 26.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe repentance hath life, a true perfect life: now where is perfect life, there is a work, it ſhoots out fruit. Hee that is a true penitent, a true convert, hath a ſpirit of life within; for faith hath purified his heart from dead works: and therefore he lives unto God, and brings forth fruit unto holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It appears there are ſuch fruits, becauſe wee have found ſuch in the examples of holy men, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented and have been converted. To preſent thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, were to ſpend away the time needleſly; and therefore I leave it to them that are well acquainted with the Bible-hiſtory, and fall unto application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If there be fruits meet for repentance, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19096:106"/> thoſe dead formes of Popiſh penances, which have no life, nor no fruits worthy of an inward life. It is true that in elder times there were ceremonious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of ſhame, appointed in the Church; as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſhews us the cuſtome of his time: <hi>Sacco &amp; Cineri incubare, corpus ſordibus obſcurare, presbyteris advolvi, &amp; aris dei adgeniculari:</hi> Yet now the popiſh penances are as blaſphemous as they are ridiculous and idle, when preſumptuous Confeſſors dare injoyne them, as ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and meritorious. We acknowledge, that nothing is more common in true religion, or more neceſſary than true repentance; which wee conceive to be the hatred of ſin, termining in the love of the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; whoſe proper Seate is in the minde and will, both being changed, the one to know, the other to love, that duty which we owe to God and man. We know, theſe inward motions are not hid; That hatred ſhewes it ſelfe by confeſſion, by tears; This love, by all works of piety and charity. But beleeve further, that it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times needfull to require &amp; receive abſolution from the Church according to the authority that Chriſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her. It is an impudent ſlander of the Jeſuits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who ſay, that wee together with the <hi>Novatian Heretikes,</hi> have taken away, not onely the name, but the power &amp; rites of eccleſiaſticall reconciliation of ſinners unto God. For we both deny, that the <hi>Novatians</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thariſts</hi> did deny, the reſtitution of the fallen by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique penance: for their errour was this, that there is no place for repentance for thoſe who fall after Baptiſme; which occaſioned the Jeſuits miſtake. And none will ſay that the <hi>Novatians</hi> denyed penance to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for that later fiction was not then invented, and therefore could not be then queſtioned. Meer Sophiſtry: By faining the <hi>Novatians</hi> to be their adverſaries, they would gain credit to their cauſe; deſiring to make their Readers beleeve the <hi>Novatians</hi> did oppoſe it; thereby hoping to prove it anciently defended, becauſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19096:106"/> reſiſted. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And for our ſelves, wee deny, that wee deny either penitence or abſolution; but wee deny penance to be a ſacrament, as having neither ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall matter, nor ſacramentall inſtitution. We juſtly finde fault with the multitude of their idle penances and their nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If there be fruits of Repentance, meet for it, and worthy of it, it gives us a ground of Tryall, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truth of our Repentance by the fruits. Wee will examine thoſe Signes particularly, according to the formerly named different acceptations; that being more diſtinct, wee may make the application cloſer to the Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Taking Repentance for Contrition; the fruit or ſigne of it is to bee truely and ſincerely ſorrowfull for ſin: but becauſe all men doe profeſſe themſelves ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, we judge of the truth of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. True and unfeined ſorrow grieves more for the offence, than for the puniſhment. It grieves at ſin, not onely as a burden, and that which wearies us with the heavie load of following wrath; but as it is a ſin, a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine Law: and from hence, it looks upon it as an odious thing, though it ſaw no puniſhment; vile and filthy, though not dangerous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Unfeined ſorrow is greateſt for ſin, greater for ſin than for other croſſes, or what els may move diſpleſure. The apprehenſion of ſin, by a ſorrow-toucht man, makes his memory &amp; thoughts bitter to him; that he is in Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes becauſe of his ſin, as one is in Bitternes for his firſt borne: according to the phraſe uſed, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Yet this tryall muſt be with caution; for a Convert doth not alwaies finde this difference of ſorrow ſenſitively, but ever <hi>Intellectivê quoad diſplicentiam voluntatis.</hi> He may be ſometimes over-born with a paſſionate ſodain grief, for the loſſe of health, or credit, or eſtate, or friend; and may be for the time miſerably diſtempered: but in his ſerious collected thoughts, hee ſees ſin as the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19096:107"/> Evill, that which drowns the thought of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And becauſe <hi>Triſtitia</hi> is <hi>ex eo quod patitur ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,</hi> as the ſchoole ſpeakes: therefore he that ſorrows for ſin, is wearied with it, and that makes him <hi>nolle peccatum,</hi> diſaffect it, and deſirous to ſhake it off. This is the firſt ſigne, True ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Taking Repentance for a generall turning, there are three ſignes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hatred of ſinne, which was the praiſe of <hi>Epheſus, This thou haſt, that thou hateſt the deeds of the Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, which I alſo hate, Rev.</hi> 2.6. The Penitent caſts not off his ſin, as the Merchant in a tempeſt throws away his goods, becauſe hee cannot keep them; but willingly, freely, becauſe hee cannot endure to looke upon them. Why are ſome men in the time of their Sickneſſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in throwing away their ſins? Not for want of love unto them, but they ſee the Sea growes high, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt rageth, they begin to apprehend what death is, and what hell is; and know, unleſſe they lighten their veſſel, they cannot be ſafe: then they are buſie in the work, they throw over-boord their uſury, their drunkenneſſe, their ſwearing, and ſuch like ſtuffe: but it is not out of hatred to their ſins, but of love to themſelves; for if they could continue in their ſins, and be ſaved when they have don, they could be contented not to part. Their practiſe and affection may be lively ſeen in <hi>Phaltiels</hi> hiſtory: <hi>David</hi> had married <hi>Michol, Saul</hi> injuriouſly gave her to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when <hi>David</hi> came to the Crown and was able to command, hee ſends for his wife <hi>Michol;</hi> her husband dares not diſobey, but brings her on her journy, and then ſends her from him: But what? Is <hi>Phaltiel</hi> weary of his <hi>Michol,</hi> that he now forſakes her? nay, hee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; and though ſhe were gone, he looks after her to <hi>Bahurim,</hi> weeping. Carnall men, though for feare, or ſome other reaſons they ſhake hands with their ſins, yet they have many a longing heart after them, and beſtow many affectionate looke; they part, and yet they are loth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19096:107"/> to part aſunder. But unfeined hatred ſues for a Bill of Divorce, and with much willingneſſe forſakes ſin, as a lewd and paltry ſtrumpet, angry that ſo long hee was wedded to it. But the truth of this appeares further.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When our hatred is againſt all ſin, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it is conſtant, without Truce, or any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſsion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When it is implacable, without articling for agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or hope of any future reconciliation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When it is vehement, without granting any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent favour or toleration. All which notions I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large profitably, but that I remember you obſerve how the time ſpends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides hatred of ſinne, there will be a purpoſe to leave, which diſcovers it ſelfe right and ſincere.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the purpoſe ſhewes it ſelfe full for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture time, againſt future ſinnes, by its readineſſe in the preſent againſt preſent ſinnes. It is the formall proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deceitfull men, That they will reforme, they will leave ſuch courſes: but, in the meane time, they earneſtly purſue, what they ſay, they doe purpoſe to leave.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When there is a purpoſe to uſe the means, as well as to reſolve the end; they meane to forſake ſinne, that ply the ordinance, that attend upon preaching, that are much in prayer, that are often in the combat: if men neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect theſe meanes, I cannot beleeve that they are fallen out with their ſins in earneſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When there is an indeavour to remove away thoſe impediments which uſually hinder the execution of the purpoſe. If a man ſay hee purpoſes to leave drinking, and yet hath no care to refraine ill company, it argues his purpoſe is deceitfull, becauſe hee ſtudies not to remove the hindrances of his purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides this hatred and purpoſe, there will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; a reformation of the whole man, an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19096:108"/> of life. Hee that can ſee his ſinne, confeſſe his ſin, weep for his ſinne, and yet returne to his ſinne againe: Beleeve not ſuch a mans repentance; for where is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? I confeſſe there may be infirmity, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent may ſometime fall into the ſinne again. But what meanes this cleaving? this continuance in ſinne? You all, if demanded, would boaſt your repentance: ſo did <hi>Saul</hi> of his obedience, in the matter of <hi>Amalek:</hi> But ſayth <hi>Samuel</hi> unto him, What then meanes the lowing of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and bleating of Sheep in mine ears? God commanded him to ſlay all; <hi>Saul</hi> ſaith he had done the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: but whence then was that noiſe? Are yee Drunkards ſtill, common Swearers ſtill, whore-maſters ſtill, Profaners of the Lords day ſtill? and come to theſe faſts as penitents? and witneſſe your boaſt of repentance? Are yee humbled as the Lord commanded? Have yee repented as the Lord comands? What meanes this noiſe? Why doth your drunkenneſſe, your oathes, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe continue? you have not done as the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, if there were true repentance there would bee reformation. This is the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Taking repentance for converſion, the ſigne of it is a new life, which is many waies diſcerned. There are new thoughts, new deſires, new delights. The ſoule dwells upon heaven, and lives by faith; by faith which ſeaſons the affections, and takes away the ſouls frettings and impatiencies, and weanes us from earthly pleaſures, making us, as weaned children, to be content with the dug or without it, teaching us ſo to look upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the breaſt what ever we count ſweet, that if God be pleaſed to give them, if God be pleaſed to deny them, ſtill to be contented. Our new life will alſo have a new appetite, a deſire after ſpirituall food, a ſigne of grace, than which I know none more common or better; for ſuch as the life is, ſuch is the nouriſhment and choice of food. But I will rather enlarge my ſelfe upon one other inſtance, the inſtance of ſpirituall motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19096:108"/> motion may be found in diverſe things, this rule muſt be diſtinctly examined. Prayer, reading, hearing, meditation, are motions; and men no other than naturall performe them: the difference is from the principle. An engin moves, and a man moves, but there is not the ſame principle of motion in the engin and the man. An engin is made of wheeles, and beeing wound up to a certaine heighth, the wheeles run, till the ſpring be downe, and then it ſtaies, and unleſſe wound up againe, continues i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, becauſe it is but an engine. But man moves from a principle of life, and hath of his owne a loco-motive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. If naturall men be upon a good motion, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſomthing windes them up, for ye may pegge and ſtrain the natural to what ye will, by preſenting ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as pleaſe them, &amp; then ſet them on going: but the motion will not hold. But the Chriſtians is from life, Chriſt is formed in them, &amp; they live by the faith of the Son of God. We may alſo ſomtimes be deceived as wel in the ſpeed as in the motion: wicked men may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon things that are good: but here is ſtill the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>What is in mee is ready.</hi> In the Chriſtian there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the word there uſed, a readineſſe, a free natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallneſſe as it were unto that which it doth. Two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes run upon their full ſpeed, but here is the tryall of the goodneſſe; The one is forced forward by the ſpur, and if the ſteele were from his ſide, the Jade would ſtand quiet; but the other, being full of ſpirit and courage, that carries him forward, that (of himſelf) he can hardly be kept in. Naturall men, if they doe any good, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpurred on: but there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the right man, it is his life that carries him on to good duties with cheerefulneſſe. Beſides, (for I can hardly leave this meditation) our ſpirituall life will ſhew it ſelfe in the uniformity of our motion: It is right, not circular. Man moves not as the ſphears orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, which is the reaſon that men are ſoone giddy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19096:109"/> when they turne round. The Chriſtian is not his own compaſſe, but moves upon a line, ſtreight to Scripture-canon. And in regard of the ſubject the motion is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, every part equally moves, and equally ſwift with the whole. If the arme, or leg, or any part move not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, but lamely, there is defect: but chiefly, if the conſerving parts be dull. The intellect, will, affections, move with an harmony, where there is this principle. This is the third ſigne or fruit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, taking repentance for an outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, the fruits or ſignes of it, are three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Contrition: I meane an outward contrition, for of inward ſorrow I ſpake before. The penitent <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> abounded in teares, they ran downe like water, that ſhe waſhed the feet of our Saviour with them. So <hi>Peter</hi> wept bitterly, hee drew plenty of that water. I cannot credit every wet eye, for ſome, like the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, have teares at will; and beſides, the conſtitution of ſome bodies (I thinke) is ſuch, that they cannot wet their cheekes; but how-ever, the heart muſt bee ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and if our conſtitution will admit it, ſometimes upon ſome occaſions our eyes. But herein we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the deceitfull pretence of dry conſtitution; when wee can be apt enough to ſhed teares for other cauſes, teares of anger, teares of griefe, teares of fullenneſſe; and then, if wee have none for ſinne, it is an Argument of deceitfull carnall hearts, for if we had not hard hearts, we ſhould not have ſuch dry eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Confeſſion: <hi>David</hi> is oft our patterne, ſo is <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> ſo is <hi>Daniel:</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth, Hee did not cover his ſinne as <hi>Adam,</hi> nor hide iniquity in his boſome, <hi>Job</hi> 31.33. Wee are not aſhamed to ſinne before men, why then ſhould we be aſhamed to confeſſe our ſinnes. But oh, when ſhall our congregations bee witneſſes of our publike repentance? When ſhall wee ſee a Drunkard come and ſay; lo, here am I, the ſcandall of your ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and faith, that have abuſed together my ſelfe and the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19096:109"/> good creatures of God, I now acknowledge in the face and ſight of heaven, how I have offended. When ſhall we ſee the uncleane perſon prevent a cenſure by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary penance? oh when? when? There muſt bee ſome ſutableneſſe in our confeſſion of ſinne unto our ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Satisfaction: That Diſcipline, Thoſe penances, which were uſed in the purer primitive times by the Church, were called Satisfactions. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> ſeeme to underſtand this Text ſo. Repentance muſt in ſome kind or other bee witneſſed by this; So <hi>Zacheus</hi> witneſſed the truth of his: and the reprobated <hi>Judas</hi> will condemne our neglect, hee ſorrowed for his fault, made confeſſion to the Prieſts, made reſtitution of the moneyes: Ah, how far more fearfull is our caſe, if wee come ſhort of the reprobated <hi>Judas?</hi> Theſe may bee the grounds of our tryall; and ſo much of the firſt Obſervation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond Obſerv. <hi>that is is our duty to bring forth fruits meet for repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It needs not explication, for all the difficulty was cleared in the former; onely let us ſee it briefly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is our duty, for there are many precepts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for the Coloſſians, that they might <hi>walke worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruitfull in every good worke, Col</hi> 1.10. Your owne reading may find more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have not only precept, but decree; wee are ordained to it: It is the end of our creation, and of our redemption: <hi>We are Gods workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that wee ſhould walk in them, Eph.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the end of Gods dealing w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> us; if he afford mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, if threats, if judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, al are to call us to repentance. His mercies are to that end: if he ſenſe his Vine-yard, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out the ſtones, dreſſe it, &amp; build a wine-preſſe, then he lookes for grapes, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5. His threatnings are to that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19096:110"/> purpoſe: he tels us he purpoſeth to ſtrike, that the Axe is ready, laid to the root, that every tree might bring forth fruit. His judgements are ſo intended, &amp; therfore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines that by them his people were not bettered; <hi>Why ſhould ye bee ſtricken any more? yee revolt more and more, Eſa.</hi> 1.5. And the towns are condemned where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour went; for if the ſame things had bin done in <hi>Tyre,</hi> it had repented long agon. Let me apply it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. If it bee our duty; it then very juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The barren, who bring forth no fruits at all. I may ſay to many, as our Saviour to thoſe in the Market place, <hi>Cur ſtatis otioſi?</hi> why ſtand ye all the day idle? men live onely as if they were ſent but to live without a farther end; I may wonder as our Saviour; Why ſtand yee all your youth idle? all your ſtrength idle? all your old age idle? what a ſhame is it, that men ſhould ſpend ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, 20, 30, 40, 50, an 100 yeares ſome, and doe nothing, make no entrance, or if an entrance, no progreſſe in grace. Hath no man hired you? Have yee not been hired by meanes, by mercies, by offers of grace? Why doe wee ſpend our ſtrength and labour to inſtruct you? wherefore have yee the Goſpel? why have ye enjoyed preaching? the benefit of ſo many ſermons, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but continue barren?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It condemns ſuch as are indeed fruitfull, but bring not forth fruits worthy of repentance. Men are but too fruitfull in the works of darkneſſe. The fruits of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the fruits of profaneneſſe, the fruits of Popery, the fruits of Atheiſme, doe every where abound. You bring forth fruits worthy of your ſelves, being ranke ground for weeds that are noyſom &amp; unprofitable. Ye bring not fruits meet for this buſineſſe and this day. A faſting day is but a bud or flower, but the fruit muſt follow after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When yee aſſemble to a worke of this nature, there is a good ſhew made, faire bloſſoms: but if there be a day of humiliation and no reformation follow; it is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19096:110"/> but a bloſſomed tree, which at length commeth to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If it bee our duty, let us be carefull of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: this application I ſhall more profitably branch; into,
<list>
                     <item>1. A direction.</item>
                     <item>2. An exhortation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A direction, how wee may be wrought unto the duty:
<list>
                     <item>1. How to repent.</item>
                     <item>2. How to bring forth worthy fruits.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A direction how to repent; I will method you in the way which you muſt take, and carry your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations through the ſeverall degrees by which yee muſt aſcend.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Learne to conſider ſinne, to conceive of it right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſee it in its owne nature. Let us not deceive our ſelves in our condition, to think our ſelves rich, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in goods, and to have need of nothing; when in deed wee are wretched and miſerable, and poore, and blind, and naked: <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. that ye may the better diſcern and do this, conſider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The infinite majeſty of God, which by your ſins is offended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The infinite bonds and relations that by your ſins are violated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The heavie wrath which upon ſuch violations from ſuch a Majeſty, by your ſinnes you have juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What good things, which otherwiſe yee might have poſſeſſed, by your ſinnes yee are deprived of, and have forfeited.</p>
               <p n="5">5 What evils, as the effects of divine wrath, by your ſins are brought upon you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The infiniteneſſe, and preciouſneſſe of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which for your ſinnes hee freely under-went. Yee may ſpread your thoughts upon theſe, and by them helpe your ſelves to the ſerious conſideration of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19096:111"/> haynous nature of ſinne, which is the firſt worke to bee done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider obedience unto God to bee a duty ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, that one thing neeedfull, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42. So neceſſary, that when ſome related <hi>Pilates</hi> fact, that hee mingled the blood of divers Galileans with their Sacrifices, CHRIST told them, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee repent yee ſhall all likewiſe periſh, Luke</hi> 13.3. Conſider repentance to bee ſo neceſſary, that without it there is no ſalvation, but ye are ſure to periſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon the apprehenſion of ſinne, and the neceſſity of repentance, goe and caſt your ſelves downe before the preſence of God, in the humbleſt maner, when you are in private alone by your ſelves: lay your ſelves open unto him; poure forth confeſſions: <hi>for if wee confeſſe our ſins, hee is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. See what encouragement <hi>David</hi> gives, <hi>I acknowledged my ſinne unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: J ſaid, I will confeſſe my Tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſinne, Pſal,</hi> 32.5. And goe and ſay unto God as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Against thee, thee onely have I ſinned, and done this evill in thy ſight. Pſal.</hi> 51.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When ye are at the loweſt, then caſt up an eye to Chriſt, by faith embrace the promiſe of life; by faith in him expect not onely the juſtification of your perſons, but the renovation of your natures; that the covenant of promiſe may be performed: challenge of Gods truth, <hi>That he would give you a new heart, and put a new ſpirit within you, that he would take away the ſtony heart of your fleſh, and give you an heart of fleſh: that he would make you remember your owne evill wayes, and your doings that were not good, that yee might loath your ſelves in your ſight for your iniquities and for your abomination. Ezek.</hi> 36.26.31.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When ye have challenged mercy and grace, then
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19096:111"/> reſolve in the ſtrength of God to returne. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your owne power, and therefore a bare ſimple reſolution will not availe you.</p>
               <p>Wee often obſerve ſuch reſolutions come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and no wonder; becauſe they are not taken in the power of God.</p>
               <p>A groſſe ſinner, in a good ſudden mood, begins to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think himſelfe, and then hee reſolves to leave his ſinne. I have heard a drunkard, when hee hath been reproved, ſay, I will leave this drinking and company-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: or a ſwearer ſay, I will refraine theſe oathes. And ſo of others.</p>
               <p>Haply ſome may commend theſe reſolves: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, dare not: I think it no commendable thing, but a remedy as dangerous as the ſinne, becauſe the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is a ſigne. You will thinke it ſtrange divinity: but obſerve whether theſe men doe not as frequently fall into the ſinne as reſolve againſt it: they reſolve not to doe it, and then doe it: they againe reſolve not to doe it, and againe they doe it: That is their courſe, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which they run round in, to ſinne, and reſolve, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, and ſinne. And obſerve, whether you ever knew one of theſe bare reſolutions to have good ſucceſſe. But this muſt be your way; Lord, I ſee what I muſt doe, but together with it I ſee what I am not able to doe: thou haſt made me willing, make mee alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: my deſires are towards grace, and ſo farre as I am able to reſolve, I doe reſolve, but it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of thy might: Oh add unto thine owne worke, perfect thine owne beginnings. This is to reſolve to repent in Gods power, and it ſucceeds; <hi>for wee are not ſufficient of our ſelves, to thinke any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiencie is of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, let us ſtrengthen our reſolutions with this care to avoid all impediments that might hinder our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning unto God. Many things do impedite or intangle
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19096:112"/> the ſoule, ſometimes worldlineſſe hangs like a clog, ſometimes love of company and pleaſure is like a ſnare about the feet; but wee muſt thruſt away ſuch, as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome importunate ſuiters, whoſe impudence will not have denyall. Wee ſhall never goe freely till we be unclogged. This is the method we muſt take in the courſe of our repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other direction is, how yee may bring forth fruits. Be not wanting to your ſelves, neglect not tillage and the right husbanding and manuring of your ground; or becauſe the metaphor is here of a tree, doe what is in your power to make a fair and flouriſhing growth. But, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> water, but God muſt give the encreaſe: therefore becauſe it is God worke, entreat him to doe it; be often and much in prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God would afford a moyſture from his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and to you grace and power to ſucke up that moyſture. The tree ſends its roots up and downe, ſome this way, ſome that, every way; to ſuck from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid earth, and of the deaw and raine that falls from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to draw what it can unto it ſelfe. Pray that God would drop downe vertue in the word, and labour dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to attract it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God would put within you, the heate of charity, that out of love you might keep the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is heate which conveyes the moyſture up into the ſap of the tree, and carries along the nutrimentall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: hence it is, that in ſpring time the trees and plants doe ſprout. Where there is love in the heart, there will be obedience in the life: <hi>Mary</hi> the penitent did much, for ſhee loved much.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pray that God would ſanctifie to you all ſeverall conditions. The winter is profitable to the plants, to ſolid and collect them: The ſummer, that they may emit or ſend without what they have collected. Pray that God would ſanctifie tryall, &amp; a more pleaſing life, both, to that end that you might be more fuitfull. This is the direction.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:19096:112"/>2. I will end with an exhottation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us endeavour to be meetly or worthily fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to be ſome way anſwerable in the degree of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to the degree of ſin. When ſhall we find pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents come blubbered into our Churches? Oh that ſuch as have beene eminent in their ſin, would bee emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in their repentance. There are ſome have an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of evill; ſometimes in a Towne or Pariſh wee ſhall know ſome who are noted, &amp; poynted at for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Drunkards: ſome are knowne by their common ſwearing: They are knowne by theſe ſins, as others are by their Trades. Oh that ſuch men would not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but give publike teſtimony of their repentance, that they might be noted for that alſo; ſuch a one, ſuch a one is a convert. O, that Drunkards, Adulterers, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Oppreſſors, Sabbath-breakers would be eminent in the contrary, in ſobriety, in the uſe of drinkes, in tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to correct their fleſh, in a ſtrict watch over their tongues, in mercy to the poore, in a conſcionable obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords dayes. We think any thing enough for God, if ye leave your callings or pleaſures for one of theſe dayes, heare, and pray out the time that the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſtayes together, yee thinke yee doe enough; you think a ſigh a great matter, the drop of a teare to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt meritorious. Ah, why ſhould wee be ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſo unanſwerable unto God. When you fall into ſin, yee purſue it violently, why ſhould there not bee ſuch zeale in the return? As ye ſinned with greedineſſe, with violence repent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In our repentance let us bee anſwerable to our ſpirituall life: let us live as ſuch as wee are. In civill relations wee can eaſily doe it, wee can live ſuitably to our eſtates, wee can very eaſily live above it. If a man baſely and meanely borne, bee raiſed by the acceſſion of a great wealth to be a Gentleman, hee can ſoone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get how hee lived when he was poore, he can very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily learn ſtately carriage, to looke high, and ſpeake big,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19096:113"/> and deſpiſe his neighbours. There are exceſſes in our carriage this way, whence it is, that the commonalty live like Gentry, the Gentry like Nobility, the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty like Princes, and Princes ſcarce know how to live. Oh that there could bee theſe exceſſes in our ſpirituall manner of life. Chriſtians live as heathens, as unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as wordlings, It is a ſhame for us to live ſo much under our ſelves. But let us endeavour, that are Saints, yet ſo much as wee can, to live as Angels, live as much as we can in heaven; have heavenly thoughts, &amp; heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires, and heavenly motions: to live, if not above, yet at leaſt anſwerable to our principle of life.</p>
               <p>Let mee conclude with an application of entreaty to your conſciences, that ye would be moved to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Wil a threat prevaile? Know then, that the Lord knoweth how to reſerve the unjuſt unto the day of judgement to be puniſhed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. The Baptiſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth this argument in his ſermon, <hi>Now the Axe is laid unto the root of the trees; therefore every tree which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not forth good fruit, is hewen downe and cast into the fire:</hi> in the tenth verſe of this Chapter. Beloved, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are come neere us: The Peſtilence is Gods Axe, and a very ſharp one, it can cut downe men ſuddenly, it can cut downe Countreys; it hath felled Preſton wood, and tall growne trees in other places: It is laid neare the root of this County, in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> on the one ſide, in <hi>Denbighſhire,</hi> on the other, in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> on this: how eaſie is it for God to fetch another blow, and lay us downe? or why ſhould wee expect to ſtand untoucht, when the wood round about us is either feld or cropt? <hi>Why doe wee deſpiſe the riches of Gods goodneſſe; and after our hardneſſe and impenitent hearts, treaſure up unto our ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgement of God? Rom.</hi> 2.5. But I will not end with a threat, but would rather deſire that the goodneſſe of God might lead us to repentance. The word that the Apoſtle uſeth is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The goodneſſe of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19096:113"/> God it leads on, or invites, or provokes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. Let this be motive enough; let his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his forbearance, that, though he be provoked, hee is patient and will not ſtrike, and his long-ſuffering, that he waits and expects when wee will returne; let theſe move us. Let the promiſe of mercy move us: let the mercy that we already have received move us, for we may obſerve that wee have not loſt the fruit of our labours, of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, of our prayers; for <hi>Sweden</hi> proſpers, and the rage of our neighbour peſtilence ceaſeth; that wee hope, ſhortly to bee as loud in our praiſes, as wee have beene ſolemne in our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations.</p>
